We &apos;re at a ti@@ pping point in human history , a species pois@@ ed between g@@ aining the stars and losing the planet we call home .
Even in just the past few years , we &apos;ve great@@ ly exp@@ and@@ ed our knowledge of how Earth fits within the context of our universe .
NASA &apos;s Ke@@ pl@@ er mission has discovered thousands of potential planets around other stars , indic@@ ating that Earth is but one of billions of planets in our galaxy .
Ke@@ pl@@ er is a space tel@@ escope that mea@@ sures the sub@@ tle di@@ m@@ ming of stars as planets pass in front of them , bloc@@ king just a little bit of that light from reach@@ ing us .
Ke@@ pl@@ er &apos;s data reve@@ als planets &apos; si@@ zes as well as their distance from their parent star .
To@@ gether , this helps us understand whether these planets are small and ro@@ cky , like the terres@@ trial planets in our own Sol@@ ar Sy@@ stem , and also how much light they rece@@ ive from their parent sun .
In turn , this provi@@ des clu@@ es as to whether these planets that we discover might be habit@@ able or not .
Un@@ fortunately , at the same time as we &apos;re disco@@ vering this tre@@ a@@ sure tro@@ ve of potenti@@ ally habit@@ able worlds , our own planet is s@@ ag@@ ging under the weight of humanity .
20@@ 14 was the hot@@ test year on record .
Gl@@ aci@@ ers and sea ice that have been with us for mill@@ en@@ nia are now dis@@ appear@@ ing in a matter of decades .
These plan@@ et@@ ar@@ y-@@ scale environmental changes that we have set in motion are rapidly out@@ p@@ ac@@ ing our ability to al@@ ter their course .
But I &apos;m not a climate scientist , I &apos;m an astronom@@ er .
I study plan@@ et@@ ary habit@@ ability as influ@@ enced by stars with the hop@@ es of finding the places in the universe where we might discover life beyond our own planet .
You could say that I look for choice alien real est@@ ate .
Now , as somebody who is deeply em@@ bed@@ ded in the search for life in the universe , I can tell you that the more you look for planets like Earth , the more you appreci@@ ate our own planet itself .
Each one of these new worlds inv@@ ites a compar@@ ison between the new@@ ly discovered planet and the planets we know best : those of our own Sol@@ ar Sy@@ stem .
Con@@ si@@ der our neighb@@ or , Mars .
Mars is small and ro@@ cky , and though it &apos;s a bit far from the Sun , it might be considered a potenti@@ ally habit@@ able world if found by a mission like Ke@@ pl@@ er .
In@@ deed , it &apos;s possible that Mars was habit@@ able in the past , and in part , this is why we study Mars so much .
Our ro@@ vers , like Cu@@ ri@@ os@@ ity , cr@@ aw@@ l across its surface , scr@@ at@@ ching for clu@@ es as to the orig@@ ins of life as we know it .
Or@@ bit@@ ers like the M@@ A@@ V@@ E@@ N mission sam@@ ple the Marti@@ an atmosphere , trying to understand how Mars might have lost its past habit@@ ability .
Pri@@ v@@ ate sp@@ ace@@ flight companies now offer not just a short trip to near space but the tan@@ tal@@ izing possibility of living our lives on Mars .
But though these Marti@@ an vis@@ t@@ as res@@ emble the des@@ er@@ ts of our own home world , places that are ti@@ ed in our imagination to ideas about pi@@ on@@ e@@ ering and fronti@@ ers , compared to Earth Mars is a pretty terrible place to live .
Con@@ si@@ der the ex@@ tent to which we have not colon@@ ized the des@@ er@@ ts of our own planet , places that are l@@ ush by compar@@ ison with Mars .
Even in the dri@@ est , highest places on Earth , the air is swe@@ et and th@@ ick with oxygen ex@@ hal@@ ed from thousands of miles away by our rain@@ forests .
I worry -- I worry that this excit@@ ement about colon@@ izing Mars and other planets car@@ ries with it a long , dark sh@@ ado@@ w : the implic@@ ation and belief by some that Mars will be there to save us from the self-@@ inf@@ lic@@ ted destruction of the only truly habit@@ able planet we know of , the Earth .
As much as I love inter@@ plan@@ et@@ ary exploration , I deeply dis@@ agree with this idea .
There are many ex@@ cellent reasons to go to Mars , but for anyone to tell you that Mars will be there to back up humanity is like the cap@@ t@@ ain of the Tit@@ an@@ ic telling you that the real party is happening later on the life@@ bo@@ ats .
Thank you .
But the goals of inter@@ plan@@ et@@ ary exploration and plan@@ et@@ ary pres@@ er@@ vation are not op@@ posed to one another .
No , they &apos;re in fact two sides of the same goal : to understand , pres@@ erve and improve life into the future .
The extreme environments of our own world are alien vis@@ t@@ as .
They &apos;re just closer to home .
If we can understand how to create and ma@@ intain habit@@ able spaces out of ho@@ sti@@ le , in@@ hosp@@ itable spaces here on Earth , perhaps we can meet the needs of both pres@@ er@@ ving our own environment and moving beyond it .
I leave you with a final thought experiment : F@@ er@@ mi &apos;s parado@@ x .
Many years ago , the physi@@ c@@ ist En@@ ri@@ co F@@ er@@ mi asked that , given the fact that our universe has been around for a very long time and we expect that there are many planets within it , we should have found evidence for alien life by now .
So where are they ?
Well , one possible solution to F@@ er@@ mi &apos;s parado@@ x is that , as civiliz@@ ations become techno@@ log@@ ically advanced enough to consider living am@@ ong@@ st the stars , they lose sight of how important it is to sa@@ fe@@ gu@@ ard the home worlds that fo@@ st@@ ered that adv@@ anc@@ ement to begin with .
It is hu@@ br@@ is to believe that inter@@ plan@@ et@@ ary colon@@ ization alone will save us from ourselves , but plan@@ et@@ ary pres@@ er@@ vation and inter@@ plan@@ et@@ ary exploration can work together .
If we truly believe in our ability to b@@ end the ho@@ sti@@ le environments of Mars for human hab@@ itation , then we should be able to sur@@ m@@ oun@@ t the far easier task of pres@@ er@@ ving the habit@@ ability of the Earth .
Thank you .
A few years ago , I broke into my own house .
I had just driven home , it was around mid@@ night in the dead of Mon@@ tre@@ al win@@ ter , I had been vis@@ iting my friend , Je@@ ff , across town , and the ther@@ mom@@ eter on the front por@@ ch read min@@ us 40 degrees -- and don &apos;t bo@@ ther asking if that &apos;s Cel@@ si@@ us or F@@ ah@@ ren@@ he@@ it , min@@ us 40 is where the two sc@@ ales meet -- it was very cold .
And as I stood on the front por@@ ch fu@@ m@@ bling in my po@@ ck@@ ets , I found I didn &apos;t have my keys .
In fact , I could see them through the window , lying on the din@@ ing room table where I had left them .
So I quickly ran around and tried all the other do@@ ors and windo@@ ws , and they were loc@@ ked ti@@ ght .
I thought about calling a loc@@ k@@ sm@@ ith -- at least I had my cell@@ phone , but at mid@@ night , it could take a while for a loc@@ k@@ sm@@ ith to show up , and it was cold .
I couldn &apos;t go back to my friend Je@@ ff &apos;s house for the night because I had an early flight to Europe the next morning , and I needed to get my pass@@ port and my su@@ it@@ case .
So , des@@ per@@ ate and free@@ zing cold , I found a large rock and I broke through the bas@@ ement window , clear@@ ed out the sh@@ ards of glass , I cr@@ aw@@ led through , I found a piece of car@@ d@@ board and tap@@ ed it up over the opening , figu@@ ring that in the morning , on the way to the air@@ port , I could call my contr@@ actor and ask him to fix it .
This was going to be expensive , but probably no more expensive than a midd@@ le-@@ of@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ night loc@@ k@@ sm@@ ith , so I figured , under the circumst@@ ances , I was coming out even .
Now , I &apos;m a neuro@@ scientist by training and I know a little bit about how the brain per@@ forms under stress .
It rele@@ ases cor@@ ti@@ sol that rai@@ ses your heart rate , it mod@@ ul@@ ates ad@@ ren@@ al@@ ine levels and it clou@@ ds your thinking .
So the next morning , when I w@@ oke up on too little sleep , wor@@ rying about the hole in the window , and a mental note that I had to call my contr@@ actor , and the free@@ zing temper@@ atures , and the me@@ et@@ ings I had up@@ coming in Europe , and , you know , with all the cor@@ ti@@ sol in my brain , my thinking was clou@@ dy , but I didn &apos;t know it was clou@@ dy because my thinking was clou@@ dy .
And it wasn &apos;t until I got to the air@@ port chec@@ k-@@ in coun@@ ter , that I realized I didn &apos;t have my pass@@ port .
So I rac@@ ed home in the s@@ now and ice , 40 minutes , got my pass@@ port , rac@@ ed back to the air@@ port , I made it just in time , but they had given away my seat to someone else , so I got stuck in the back of the plane , next to the b@@ ath@@ rooms , in a seat that wouldn &apos;t re@@ cl@@ ine , on an e@@ igh@@ t-@@ hour flight .
Well , I had a lot of time to think during those eight hours and no sleep .
And I started wondering , are there things that I can do , systems that I can put into place , that will prevent bad things from happening ?
Or at least if bad things happen , will minim@@ ize the lik@@ eli@@ hood of it being a total catastr@@ ophe .
So I started thinking about that , but my thoughts didn &apos;t cry@@ st@@ alli@@ ze until about a month later .
I was having dinner with my colle@@ ague , D@@ anny K@@ ah@@ n@@ em@@ an , the Nobel Pri@@ ze win@@ ner , and I some@@ what emb@@ arr@@ asse@@ dly told him about having broken my window , and , you know , for@@ gotten my pass@@ port , and D@@ anny shared with me that he &apos;d been prac@@ tic@@ ing something called pro@@ spec@@ tive h@@ ind@@ sight .
It &apos;s something that he had gotten from the psycho@@ logist G@@ ary K@@ le@@ in , who had written about it a few years before , also called the pre-@@ mor@@ te@@ m .
Now , you all know what the pos@@ t@@ mor@@ te@@ m is .
Wh@@ enever there &apos;s a disaster , a team of experts come in and they try to figure out what went wrong , right ?
Well , in the pre-@@ mor@@ te@@ m , D@@ anny expl@@ ained , you look ahead and you try to figure out all the things that could go wrong , and then you try to figure out what you can do to prevent those things from happening , or to minim@@ ize the damage .
So what I want to talk to you about today are some of the things we can do in the form of a pre-@@ mor@@ te@@ m .
Some of them are obvious , some of them are not so obvious .
I &apos;ll start with the obvious ones .
Ar@@ ound the home , design@@ ate a place for things that are easily lost .
Now , this sounds like common sense , and it is , but there &apos;s a lot of science to back this up , based on the way our spatial memory works .
There &apos;s a structure in the brain called the hi@@ p@@ po@@ campus , that evolved over tens of thousands of years , to keep track of the loc@@ ations of important things -- where the well is , where fish can be found , that stand of fruit trees , where the friend@@ ly and enem@@ y tri@@ bes live .
The hi@@ p@@ po@@ campus is the part of the brain that in London tax@@ ic@@ ab dri@@ vers becomes en@@ larg@@ ed .
It &apos;s the part of the brain that allows squ@@ ir@@ rels to find their nu@@ ts .
And if you &apos;re wondering , somebody actually did the experiment where they cut off the ol@@ factory sense of the squ@@ ir@@ rels , and they could still find their nu@@ ts .
They weren &apos;t using smell , they were using the hi@@ p@@ po@@ campus , this ex@@ qu@@ is@@ itely evolved mechan@@ ism in the brain for finding things .
But it &apos;s really good for things that don &apos;t move around much , not so good for things that move around .
So this is why we lose car keys and reading gl@@ asses and pass@@ ports .
So in the home , design@@ ate a spot for your keys -- a ho@@ ok by the door , maybe a dec@@ or@@ ative bo@@ w@@ l .
For your pass@@ port , a particular dra@@ wer .
For your reading gl@@ asses , a particular table .
If you design@@ ate a spot and you &apos;re s@@ cru@@ pul@@ ous about it , your things will always be there when you look for them .
What about travel ?
Take a cell phone picture of your credit cards , your driver &apos;s lic@@ ense , your pass@@ port , mail it to yourself so it &apos;s in the cloud .
If these things are lost or st@@ ol@@ en , you can facil@@ it@@ ate re@@ placement .
Now these are some rather obvious things .
Rem@@ ember , when you &apos;re under stress , the brain rele@@ ases cor@@ ti@@ sol .
Cor@@ ti@@ sol is tox@@ ic , and it causes clou@@ dy thinking .
So part of the practice of the pre-@@ mor@@ te@@ m is to recognize that under stress you &apos;re not going to be at your best , and you should put systems in place .
And there &apos;s perhaps no more str@@ ess@@ ful a situation than when you &apos;re confron@@ ted with a medical decision to make .
And at some point , all of us are going to be in that position , where we have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or that of a loved one , to help them with a decision .
And so I want to talk about that .
And I &apos;m going to talk about a very particular medical condition .
But this st@@ ands as a pro@@ x@@ y for all kinds of medical dec@@ isi@@ on-@@ making , and indeed for financial dec@@ isi@@ on-@@ making , and social dec@@ isi@@ on-@@ making -- any kind of decision you have to make that would benefit from a rational ass@@ ess@@ ment of the facts .
So suppose you go to your doctor and the doctor says , &quot; I just got your lab work back , your chol@@ ester@@ ol &apos;s a little high . &quot;
Now , you all know that high chol@@ ester@@ ol is associated with an increas@@ ed risk of cardi@@ o@@ vas@@ cul@@ ar disease , heart attack , str@@ oke .
And so you &apos;re thinking having high chol@@ ester@@ ol isn &apos;t the best thing , and so the doctor says , &quot; You know , I &apos;d like to give you a drug that will help you lower your chol@@ ester@@ ol , a stati@@ n . &quot;
And you &apos;ve probably heard of stat@@ ins , you know that they &apos;re among the most wid@@ ely pres@@ cri@@ bed drugs you probably even know people who take them .
And so you &apos;re thinking , &quot; Yeah ! G@@ ive me the stati@@ n . &quot;
But there &apos;s a question you should ask at this point , a stati@@ stic you should ask for that most doctors don &apos;t like talking about , and pharmaceu@@ tical companies like talking about even less .
It &apos;s for the number needed to treat .
Now , what is this , the N@@ N@@ T ?
It &apos;s the number of people that need to take a drug or under@@ go a surgery or any medical proce@@ dure before one person is helped .
And you &apos;re thinking , what kind of crazy stati@@ stic is that ?
The number should be one .
My doctor wouldn &apos;t pres@@ cri@@ be something to me if it &apos;s not going to help .
But actually , medical practice doesn &apos;t work that way .
And it &apos;s not the doctor &apos;s fau@@ lt , if it &apos;s anybody &apos;s fau@@ lt , it &apos;s the fau@@ lt of scientists like me .
We haven &apos;t figured out the under@@ lying mechan@@ is@@ ms well enough .
But G@@ la@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mi@@ th@@ K@@ line esti@@ mates that 90 percent of the drugs work in only 30 to 50 percent of the people .
So the number needed to treat for the most wid@@ ely pres@@ cri@@ bed stati@@ n , what do you suppose it is ?
How many people have to take it before one person is helped ?
300 .
This is according to research by research practi@@ tion@@ ers Jer@@ ome Gro@@ op@@ man and P@@ am@@ ela Har@@ t@@ z@@ band , in@@ depend@@ ently confir@@ med by B@@ lo@@ omb@@ erg@@ .com .
I ran through the numbers myself .
300 people have to take the drug for a year before one heart attack , str@@ oke or other ad@@ verse event is prev@@ ented .
Now you &apos;re probably thinking , &quot; Well , OK , one in 300 chance of lo@@ wer@@ ing my chol@@ ester@@ ol .
Why not , do@@ c ? G@@ ive me the pres@@ cri@@ ption anyway . &quot;
But you should ask at this point for another stati@@ stic , and that is , &quot; T@@ ell me about the side effects . &quot; Right ?
So for this particular drug , the side effects occu@@ r in five percent of the patients .
And they include terrible things -- de@@ bil@@ it@@ ating muscle and jo@@ int pain , g@@ as@@ tro@@ int@@ est@@ inal distr@@ ess -- but now you &apos;re thinking , &quot; F@@ ive percent , not very likely it &apos;s going to happen to me , I &apos;ll still take the drug . &quot;
But wait a minute .
Rem@@ ember under stress you &apos;re not thinking clearly .
So think about how you &apos;re going to work through this ahead of time , so you don &apos;t have to manu@@ fac@@ ture the chain of reas@@ oning on the spot .
300 people take the drug , right ? One person &apos;s helped , five percent of those 300 have side effects , that &apos;s 15 people .
You &apos;re 15 times more likely to be har@@ med by the drug than you are to be helped by the drug .
Now , I &apos;m not saying whether you should take the stati@@ n or not .
I &apos;m just saying you should have this conversation with your doctor .
Medic@@ al eth@@ ics requires it , it &apos;s part of the principle of inform@@ ed con@@ sent .
You have the right to have access to this kind of information to begin the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not .
Now you might be thinking I &apos;ve pul@@ led this number out of the air for shoc@@ k value , but in fact it &apos;s rather typical , this number needed to treat .
For the most wid@@ ely perform@@ ed surgery on men over the age of 50 , re@@ mo@@ v@@ al of the pro@@ state for cancer , the number needed to treat is 4@@ 9 .
That &apos;s right , 4@@ 9 sur@@ ger@@ ies are done for every one person who &apos;s helped .
And the side effects in that case occu@@ r in 50 percent of the patients .
They include im@@ po@@ t@@ ence , er@@ ec@@ tile dy@@ s@@ function , ur@@ in@@ ary in@@ contin@@ ence , rec@@ tal t@@ earing , f@@ ec@@ al in@@ contin@@ ence .
And if you &apos;re lucky , and you &apos;re one of the 50 percent who has these , they &apos;ll only last for a year or two .
So the idea of the pre-@@ mor@@ te@@ m is to think ahead of time to the questions that you might be able to ask that will push the conversation forward .
You don &apos;t want to have to manu@@ fac@@ ture all of this on the spot .
And you also want to think about things like quality of life .
Because you have a choice of@@ ten@@ times , do you I want a shor@@ ter life that &apos;s pain@@ -@@ free , or a longer life that might have a great deal of pain towards the end ?
These are things to talk about and think about now , with your family and your loved ones .
You might change your mind in the heat of the moment , but at least you &apos;re prac@@ tic@@ ed with this kind of thinking .
Rem@@ ember , our brain under stress rele@@ ases cor@@ ti@@ sol , and one of the things that happens at that moment is a whole bunch on systems sh@@ ut down .
There &apos;s an evolutionary reason for this .
F@@ ac@@ e-@@ to-@@ face with a pre@@ dat@@ or , you don &apos;t need your dig@@ es@@ tive system , or your li@@ bi@@ do , or your imm@@ une system , because if you &apos;re body is exp@@ ending met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ism on those things and you don &apos;t re@@ act quickly , you might become the li@@ on &apos;s lunch , and then none of those things matter .
Un@@ fortunately , one of the things that goes out the window during those times of stress is rational , logical thinking , as D@@ anny K@@ ah@@ n@@ em@@ an and his colleagues have shown .
So we need to train ourselves to think ahead to these kinds of situations .
I think the important point here is recogni@@ zing that all of us are fl@@ aw@@ ed .
We all are going to fail now and then .
The idea is to think ahead to what those failu@@ res might be , to put systems in place that will help minim@@ ize the damage , or to prevent the bad things from happening in the first place .
G@@ etting back to that s@@ now@@ y night in Mon@@ tre@@ al , when I got back from my trip , I had my contr@@ actor inst@@ all a combin@@ ation lock next to the door , with a key to the front door in it , an easy to remember combin@@ ation .
And I have to ad@@ mit , I still have pi@@ les of mail that haven &apos;t been sor@@ ted , and pi@@ les of em@@ ails that I haven &apos;t gone through .
So I &apos;m not completely organized , but I see organization as a gradu@@ al process , and I &apos;m getting there .
Thank you very much .
Inter@@ pre@@ ter : Pi@@ ano , &quot; p , &quot; is my favorite musical symbo@@ l .
It means to play sof@@ tly .
If you &apos;re playing a musical instrument and you notice a &quot; p &quot; in the score , you need to play sof@@ ter .
Two p &apos;s -- even sof@@ ter .
F@@ our p &apos;s -- extremely soft .
This is my drawing of a p@@ -@@ tree , which demonstr@@ ates no matter how many thousands upon thousands of p &apos;s there may be , you &apos;ll never reach complete silence .
That &apos;s my current definition of silence : a very obs@@ cure sound .
I &apos;d like to share a little bit about the history of American S@@ ign L@@ angu@@ age , A@@ S@@ L , plus a bit of my own background .
French sign language was brought to America during the early 18@@ 0@@ 0s , and as time went by , mix@@ ed with local signs , it evolved into the language we know today as A@@ S@@ L .
So it has a history of about 200 years .
I was born dea@@ f , and I was taught to believe that sound wasn &apos;t a part of my life .
And I believed it to be true .
Yet , I realize now that that wasn &apos;t the case at all .
S@@ ound was very much a part of my life , really , on my mind every day .
As a D@@ ea@@ f person living in a world of sound , it &apos;s as if I was living in a foreign country , bl@@ ind@@ ly following its rules , cu@@ st@@ oms , behavi@@ ors and nor@@ ms without ever ques@@ tioning them .
So how is it that I understand sound ?
Well , I watch how people be@@ have and respond to sound .
You people are like my lou@@ d@@ spea@@ kers , and am@@ pli@@ fy sound .
I learn and mir@@ ror that behavior .
At the same time , I &apos;ve learned that I create sound , and I &apos;ve seen how people respond to me .
Th@@ us I &apos;ve learned , for example ...
&quot; Don &apos;t sl@@ am the door ! &quot;
&quot; Don &apos;t make too much noise when you &apos;re eating from the po@@ tat@@ o-@@ chi@@ p b@@ ag ! &quot;
&quot; Don &apos;t bur@@ p , and when you &apos;re eating , make sure you don &apos;t scr@@ ape your u@@ ten@@ s@@ ils on the plate . &quot;
All of these things I term &quot; sound e@@ ti@@ quette . &quot;
Maybe I think about sound e@@ ti@@ quette more than the average hearing person does .
I &apos;m hyper@@ -@@ vi@@ g@@ il@@ ant around sound .
And I &apos;m always waiting in e@@ ager nervous anticip@@ ation around sound , about what &apos;s to come next .
H@@ ence , this drawing .
T@@ B@@ D , to be decided .
T@@ BC , to be continu@@ ed .
T@@ B@@ A , to be announc@@ ed .
And you notice the staf@@ f -- there are no notes cont@@ ained in the lines .
That &apos;s because the lines already cont@@ ain sound through the sub@@ tle s@@ mu@@ d@@ ges and sm@@ ears .
In D@@ ea@@ f culture , movement is equivalent to sound .
This is a sign for &quot; staf@@ f &quot; in A@@ S@@ L .
A typical staf@@ f cont@@ ains five lines .
Yet for me , sig@@ ning it with my th@@ um@@ b stic@@ king up like that doesn &apos;t feel natural .
That &apos;s why you &apos;ll notice in my dra@@ wings , I stick to four lines on paper .
In the year 2008 , I had the opportunity to travel to Ber@@ lin , Germany , for an artist res@@ id@@ ency there .
Pri@@ or to this time , I had been working as a pain@@ ter .
Dur@@ ing this summer , I vis@@ ited different mus@@ eu@@ ms and g@@ all@@ ery spaces , and as I went from one place to the next , I noticed there was no visual art there .
At that time , sound was tr@@ ending , and this struc@@ k me ...
there was no visual art , everything was audit@@ ory .
Now sound has come into my art territ@@ ory .
Is it going to further distance me from art ?
I realized that doesn &apos;t have to be the case at all .
I actually know sound .
I know it so well that it doesn &apos;t have to be something just experienced through the ears .
It could be felt t@@ actually , or experienced as a visual , or even as an idea .
So I decided to re@@ claim ow@@ ner@@ ship of sound and to put it into my art practice .
And everything that I had been taught regar@@ ding sound , I decided to do away with and un@@ learn .
I started creating a new body of work .
And when I pres@@ ented this to the art community , I was blo@@ wn away with the amount of support and attention I received .
I realized : sound is like money , power , control -- social curr@@ ency .
In the back of my mind , I &apos;ve always felt that sound was your thing , a hearing person &apos;s thing .
And sound is so powerful that it could either dis@@ em@@ power me and my art@@ work , or it could em@@ power me .
I chose to be em@@ powered .
There &apos;s a massive culture around spo@@ ken language .
And just because I don &apos;t use my liter@@ al voice to communicate , in society &apos;s eyes it &apos;s as if I don &apos;t have a voice at all .
So I need to work with individuals who can support me as an equal and become my voice .
And that way , I &apos;m able to ma@@ intain relev@@ ancy in society today .
So at school , at work and institutions , I work with many different A@@ S@@ L inter@@ pre@@ ters .
And their voice becomes my voice and identity .
They help me to be heard .
And their voices hold value and curr@@ ency .
I@@ ron@@ ically , by bor@@ ro@@ wing out their voices , I &apos;m able to ma@@ intain a tempor@@ ary form of curr@@ ency , kind of like taking out a lo@@ an with a very high interest rate .
If I didn &apos;t continue this practice , I feel that I could just fa@@ de off into ob@@ li@@ vi@@ on and not ma@@ intain any form of social curr@@ ency .
So with sound as my new art medi@@ um , I del@@ ved into the world of music .
And I was surprised to see the simil@@ ari@@ ties between music and A@@ S@@ L .
For example , a musical note cannot be fully cap@@ tured and ex@@ pressed on paper .
And the same hol@@ ds true for a concept in A@@ S@@ L .
They &apos;re both highly spatial and highly infl@@ ected -- meaning that sub@@ tle changes can affect the entire meaning of both signs and sounds .
I &apos;d like to share with you a piano metaphor , to have you have a better understanding of how A@@ S@@ L works .
So , en@@ vision a piano .
A@@ S@@ L is broken down into many different gram@@ mati@@ cal par@@ am@@ eters .
If you as@@ sign a different par@@ am@@ eter to each finger as you play the piano -- such as fac@@ ial expression , body movement , speed , hand shape and so on , as you play the piano -- English is a lin@@ ear language , as if one key is being pressed at a time .
However , A@@ S@@ L is more like a ch@@ ord -- all 10 fin@@ gers need to come down simul@@ tane@@ ously to express a clear concept or idea in A@@ S@@ L .
If just one of those keys were to change the ch@@ ord , it would create a completely different meaning .
The same appli@@ es to music in regar@@ ds to pit@@ ch , t@@ one and volume .
In A@@ S@@ L , by playing around with these different gram@@ mati@@ cal par@@ am@@ eters , you can express different ideas .
For example , take the sign T@@ O@@ -@@ L@@ O@@ O@@ K@@ -@@ A@@ T .
This is the sign T@@ O@@ -@@ L@@ O@@ O@@ K@@ -@@ A@@ T .
I &apos;m looking at you .
St@@ ar@@ ing at you .
Oh -- bu@@ st@@ ed .
U@@ h@@ -@@ oh .
What are you looking at ?
A@@ w , stop .
I then started thinking , &quot; What if I was to look at A@@ S@@ L through a musical l@@ ens ? &quot;
If I was to create a sign and repe@@ at it over and over , it could become like a piece of visual music .
For example , this is the sign for &quot; day , &quot; as the sun ris@@ es and sets .
This is &quot; all day . &quot;
If I was to repe@@ at it and slow it down , visu@@ ally it looks like a piece of music .
All ... day .
I feel the same hol@@ ds true for &quot; all night . &quot;
&quot; All night . &quot;
This is A@@ L@@ L@@ -@@ N@@ I@@ G@@ H@@ T , repres@@ ented in this drawing .
And this led me to thinking about three different kinds of ni@@ ghts : &quot; last night , &quot; &quot; over@@ night , &quot; &quot; all night long . &quot;
I feel like the third one has a lot more mu@@ si@@ c@@ ality than the other two .
This represents how time is ex@@ pressed in A@@ S@@ L and how the distance from your body can express the changes in time .
For example , 1@@ H is one hand , 2@@ H is two hand , present ten@@ se happens clo@@ s@@ est and in front of the body , future is in front of the body and the past is to your back .
So , the first example is &quot; a long time ago . &quot;
Then &quot; past , &quot; &quot; used to &quot; and the last one , which is my favorite , with the very roman@@ tic and dram@@ atic notion to it , &quot; once upon a time . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ mon time &quot; is a musical term with a specific time sig@@ nature of four be@@ ats per measure .
Yet when I see the word &quot; common time , &quot; what autom@@ atically comes to mind for me is &quot; at the same time . &quot;
So notice R@@ H : right hand , L@@ H : left hand .
We have the staf@@ f across the head and the ch@@ est .
&#91; H@@ ead : R@@ H , Fl@@ ash cl@@ a@@ w &#93; &#91; Com@@ mon time &#93; &#91; Ch@@ est : L@@ H , Fl@@ ash cl@@ a@@ w &#93; I &apos;m now going to demonstr@@ ate a hand shape called the &quot; fl@@ ash cl@@ a@@ w . &quot;
Can you please follow along with me ?
Everybody , hands up .
Now we &apos;re going to do it in both the head and the ch@@ est , kind of like &quot; common time &quot; or at the same time .
Yes , got it .
That means &quot; to fall in love &quot; in International &#91; S@@ ign &#93; .
International &#91; S@@ ign &#93; , as a note , is a visual tool to help communicate across cultures and sign languages around the world .
The second one I &apos;d like to demonstr@@ ate is this -- please follow along with me again .
And now this .
This is &quot; colon@@ ization &quot; in A@@ S@@ L .
Now the third -- please follow along again .
And again .
This is &quot; en@@ li@@ ghten@@ ment &quot; in A@@ S@@ L .
So let &apos;s do all three together .
&quot; F@@ all in love , &quot; &quot; colon@@ ization &quot; and &quot; en@@ li@@ ghten@@ ment . &quot;
Good job , everyone .
No@@ tice how all three signs are very similar , they all happen at the head and the ch@@ est , but they conv@@ ey quite different mean@@ ings .
So it &apos;s amazing to see how A@@ S@@ L is alive and th@@ ri@@ ving , just like music is .
However , in this day and age , we live in a very audi@@ o-@@ cen@@ tric world .
And just because A@@ S@@ L has no sound to it , it autom@@ atically hol@@ ds no social curr@@ ency .
We need to start thinking harder about what defin@@ es social curr@@ ency and allow A@@ S@@ L to develop its own form of curr@@ ency -- without sound .
And this could possibly be a step to lead to a more inclu@@ sive society .
And maybe people will understand that you don &apos;t need to be dea@@ f to learn A@@ S@@ L , nor do you have to be hearing to learn music .
A@@ S@@ L is such a rich tre@@ a@@ sure that I &apos;d like you to have the same experience .
And I &apos;d like to invite you to open your ears , to open your eyes , take part in our culture and experience our visual language .
And you never know , you might just fall in love with us .
Thank you .
Den@@ ise K@@ ah@@ l@@ er-@@ Bra@@ at@@ en : Hey , that &apos;s me .
When I was a kid , my parents would tell me , &quot; You can make a m@@ ess , but you have to clean up after yourself . &quot;
So freedom came with responsibility .
But my imagination would take me to all these wonderful places , where everything was possible .
So I grew up in a bu@@ bble of inno@@ c@@ ence -- or a bu@@ bble of ignorance , I should say , because adults would lie to us to protect us from the u@@ g@@ ly truth .
And growing up , I found out that adults make a m@@ ess , and they &apos;re not very good at clean@@ ing up after themselves .
F@@ ast forward , I am an adult now , and I teach citiz@@ en science and invention at the H@@ ong K@@ ong Har@@ b@@ our School .
And it doesn &apos;t take too long before my students walk on a be@@ ach and stu@@ m@@ ble upon pi@@ les of tr@@ ash .
So as good citizens , we clean up the b@@ ea@@ ches -- and no , he is not dr@@ inking al@@ co@@ ho@@ l , and if he is , I did not give it to him .
And so it &apos;s sad to say , but today more than 80 percent of the oceans have plastic in them .
It &apos;s a horri@@ fying fact .
And in past decades , we &apos;ve been taking those big ships out and those big nets , and we collect those plastic bits that we look at under a microscope , and we sort them , and then we put this data onto a map .
But that takes forever , it &apos;s very expensive , and so it &apos;s quite ris@@ ky to take those big bo@@ ats out .
So with my students , ages six to 15 , we &apos;ve been dre@@ aming of invent@@ ing a better way .
So we &apos;ve transform@@ ed our tiny H@@ ong K@@ ong classroom into a work@@ shop .
And so we started building this small work@@ ben@@ ch , with different he@@ i@@ ghts , so even really short kids can particip@@ ate .
And let me tell you , kids with power tools are awesome and safe .
Not really .
And so , back to plastic .
We collect this plastic and we gr@@ ind it to the size we find it in the ocean , which is very small because it brea@@ ks down .
And so this is how we work .
I let the imagin@@ ations of my students run wild .
And my job is to try to collect the best of each kid &apos;s idea and try to combine it into something that hopefully would work .
And so we have agre@@ ed that instead of collec@@ ting plastic bits , we are going to collect only the data .
So we &apos;re going to get an image of the plastic with a robot -- so robots , kids get very excited .
And the next thing we do -- we do what we call &quot; rap@@ id prototy@@ ping . &quot;
We are so rap@@ id at prototy@@ ping that the lunch is still in the lun@@ ch@@ box when we &apos;re h@@ acking it .
And we h@@ ack table lam@@ ps and web@@ cam@@ s , into plu@@ m@@ bing fix@@ tures and we assemble that into a flo@@ ating robot that will be slowly moving through water and through the plastic that we have there -- and this is the image that we get in the robot .
So we see the plastic pieces flo@@ ating slowly through the sens@@ or , and the computer on board will process this image , and measure the size of each parti@@ cle , so we have a r@@ ough estim@@ ate of how much plastic there is in the water .
So we document@@ ed this invention step by step on a website for invent@@ ors called In@@ struc@@ tables , in the hope that somebody would make it even better .
What was really cool about this project was that the students saw a local problem , and bo@@ om -- they are trying to immediately address it .
&#91; I can investig@@ ate my local problem &#93; But my students in H@@ ong K@@ ong are hyper@@ connected kids .
And they watch the news , they watch the Internet , and they came across this image .
This was a child , probably under 10 , clean@@ ing up an oil sp@@ ill bar@@ e-@@ hand@@ ed , in the S@@ un@@ dar@@ b@@ ans , which is the world &apos;s largest mang@@ ro@@ ve forest in B@@ angl@@ ad@@ esh .
So they were very shoc@@ ked , because this is the water they drink , this is the water they b@@ a@@ the in , this is the water they fish in -- this is the place where they live .
And also you can see the water is bro@@ wn , the mu@@ d is bro@@ wn and oil is bro@@ wn , so when everything is mix@@ ed up , it &apos;s really hard to see what &apos;s in the water .
But , there &apos;s a technology that &apos;s rather simple , that &apos;s called spec@@ trom@@ etry , that allows you see what &apos;s in the water .
So we built a r@@ ough prototype of a spec@@ trom@@ eter , and you can sh@@ ine light through different subst@@ ances that produce different spec@@ tru@@ ms , so that can help you identify what &apos;s in the water .
So we p@@ acked this prototype of a sens@@ or , and we shi@@ pped it to B@@ angl@@ ad@@ esh .
So what was cool about this project was that beyond ad@@ dr@@ essing a local problem , or looking at a local problem , my students used their empath@@ y and their sense of being creative to help , rem@@ ot@@ ely , other kids .
&#91; I can investig@@ ate a remote problem &#93; So I was very comp@@ ell@@ ed by doing the second experiments , and I wanted to take it even further -- maybe ad@@ dr@@ essing an even harder problem , and it &apos;s also closer to my heart .
So I &apos;m half Japanese and half French , and maybe you remember in 2011 there was a massive ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake in Japan .
It was so violent that it tr@@ ig@@ g@@ ered several giant waves -- they are called t@@ su@@ nam@@ i -- and those t@@ su@@ nam@@ i destro@@ yed many cities on the eas@@ tern coast of Japan .
More than 14@@ ,000 people died in an instant .
Al@@ so , it dam@@ aged the nuclear power plant of F@@ u@@ k@@ ush@@ im@@ a , the nuclear power plant just by the water .
And today , I read the re@@ ports and an average of 300 tons are lea@@ king from the nuclear power plant into the Paci@@ fic O@@ ce@@ an .
And today the whole Paci@@ fic O@@ ce@@ an has tr@@ aces of cont@@ amin@@ ation of c@@ es@@ i@@ um@@ -@@ 1@@ 3@@ 7 .
If you go outside on the West Co@@ ast , you can measure F@@ u@@ k@@ ush@@ im@@ a everywhere .
But if you look at the map , it can look like most of the radi@@ o@@ activity has been wash@@ ed away from the Japanese coast , and most of it is now -- it looks like it &apos;s safe , it &apos;s blue .
Well , reality is a bit more complicated than this .
So I &apos;ve been going to F@@ u@@ k@@ ush@@ im@@ a every year since the accident , and I measure in@@ depend@@ ently and with other scientists , on land , in the river -- and this time we wanted to take the kids .
So of course we didn &apos;t take the kids , the parents wouldn &apos;t allow that to happen .
But every night we would report to &quot; M@@ ission Con@@ tro@@ l &quot; -- different mas@@ ks they &apos;re wearing .
It could look like they didn &apos;t take the work seriously , but they really did because they &apos;re going to have to live with radi@@ o@@ activity their whole life .
And so what we did with them is that we &apos;d discus@@ s the data we coll@@ ected that day , and talk about where we should be going next -- strategy , it@@ in@@ er@@ ary , etc ...
And to do this , we built a very r@@ ough to@@ po@@ graph@@ ical map of the region around the nuclear power plant .
And so we built the el@@ ev@@ ation map , we s@@ prin@@ k@@ led pig@@ ments to represent re@@ al-@@ time data for radi@@ o@@ activity , and we spr@@ ayed water to simul@@ ate the rain@@ fall .
And with this we could see that the radi@@ o@@ active d@@ ust was wash@@ ing from the top of the mountain into the river system , and lea@@ king into the ocean .
So it was a r@@ ough estim@@ ate .
But with this in mind , we organized this ex@@ pe@@ dition , which was the clo@@ s@@ est civi@@ li@@ ans have been to the nuclear power plant .
We are s@@ ail@@ ing 1.@@ 5 kilometers away from the nuclear power plant , and with the help of the local fish@@ er@@ man , we are collec@@ ting se@@ di@@ ment from the se@@ ab@@ ed with a cu@@ st@@ om se@@ di@@ ment sam@@ pl@@ er we &apos;ve invented and built .
We p@@ ack the se@@ di@@ ment into small b@@ ags , we then dis@@ pat@@ ch them to hundreds of small b@@ ags that we send to different univer@@ si@@ ties , and we produce the map of the se@@ ab@@ ed radi@@ o@@ activity , especially in es@@ tu@@ aries where the fish will re@@ produce , and I will hope that we will have impro@@ ved the safety of the local fish@@ er@@ men and of your favorite su@@ sh@@ i .
You can see a progr@@ ession here -- we &apos;ve gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem .
And it &apos;s been super exciting to work at these different sc@@ ales , with also very simple , open-source technologies .
But at the same time , it &apos;s been increasingly frustr@@ ating because we have only started to measure the damage that we have done .
We haven &apos;t even started to try to solve the problems .
And so I wonder if we should just take a lea@@ p and try to invent better ways to do all these things .
And so the classroom started to feel a little bit small , so we found an industrial site in H@@ ong K@@ ong , and we turned it into the largest me@@ g@@ a-@@ space focused on social and environmental impact .
It &apos;s in central H@@ ong K@@ ong , and it &apos;s a place we can work with wood , met@@ al , chemistry , a bit of biology , a bit of op@@ tics , basically you can build pretty much everything there .
And its a place where adults and kids can play together .
It &apos;s a place where kids &apos; dreams can come true , with the help of adults , and where adults can be kids again .
Stu@@ dent : Ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ation ! Ac@@ cel@@ er@@ ation !
C@@ es@@ ar Har@@ ada : We &apos;re asking questions such as , can we invent the future of mo@@ bility with ren@@ ew@@ able energy ?
For example .
Or , can we help the mo@@ bility of the aging population by transform@@ ing very standard whe@@ el@@ ch@@ airs into cool , electric vehic@@ les ?
So plastic , oil and radi@@ o@@ activity are horrible , horrible leg@@ ac@@ ies , but the very worst leg@@ acy that we can leave our children is lies .
We can no longer afford to shi@@ eld the kids from the u@@ g@@ ly truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions .
So citiz@@ en scientists , ma@@ kers , dre@@ am@@ ers -- we must pre@@ pare the next generation that car@@ es about the environment and people , and that can actually do something about it .
Thank you .
Two tw@@ in dom@@ es , two radic@@ ally op@@ posed design cultures .
One is made of thousands of ste@@ el parts , the other of a single sil@@ k th@@ read .
One is syn@@ thetic , the other organic .
One is im@@ posed on the environment , the other creates it .
One is designed for nature , the other is designed by her .
Mich@@ el@@ ang@@ el@@ o said that when he looked at ra@@ w mar@@ ble , he saw a figure stru@@ ggl@@ ing to be free .
The ch@@ is@@ el was Mich@@ el@@ ang@@ el@@ o &apos;s only tool .
But living things are not ch@@ is@@ eled .
They grow .
And in our small@@ est un@@ its of life , our cells , we carry all the information that &apos;s required for every other cell to function and to replic@@ ate .
To@@ ols also have consequences .
At least since the In@@ d@@ us@@ trial R@@ evolution , the world of design has been domin@@ ated by the ri@@ g@@ ors of manufactu@@ ring and mass production .
A@@ ss@@ em@@ bly lines have dic@@ t@@ ated a world made of parts , fr@@ aming the imagination of designers and archit@@ ects who have been trained to think about their objects as ass@@ em@@ bli@@ es of dis@@ cre@@ te parts with distinc@@ t func@@ tions .
But you don &apos;t find hom@@ o@@ gen@@ ous material ass@@ em@@ bli@@ es in nature .
Take human skin , for example .
Our fac@@ ial sk@@ ins are thin with large po@@ res .
Our back sk@@ ins are th@@ ic@@ ker , with small po@@ res .
One acts main@@ ly as fil@@ ter , the other main@@ ly as barri@@ er , and yet it &apos;s the same skin : no parts , no ass@@ em@@ bli@@ es .
It &apos;s a system that gradu@@ ally v@@ aries its func@@ tion@@ ality by v@@ ar@@ ying el@@ as@@ tic@@ ity .
So here this is a sp@@ lit screen to represent my sp@@ lit world view , the sp@@ lit person@@ ality of every designer and archit@@ ect operating today between the ch@@ is@@ el and the gene , between machine and organis@@ m , between ass@@ em@@ bly and growth , between Hen@@ ry For@@ d and Charles Darwin .
These two world@@ vie@@ ws , my left brain and right brain , analysis and syn@@ thesis , will play out on the two scre@@ ens behind me .
My work , at its simpl@@ est level , is about un@@ iting these two world@@ vie@@ ws , moving away from ass@@ em@@ bly and closer into growth .
You &apos;re probably asking y@@ ourselves : Why now ?
Why was this not possible 10 or even five years ago ?
We live in a very special time in history , a rare time , a time when the conf@@ lu@@ ence of four fields is giving designers access to tools we &apos;ve never had access to before .
These fields are compu@@ t@@ ational design , allo@@ wing us to design complex forms with simple code ; addi@@ tive manufactu@@ ring , l@@ etting us produce parts by ad@@ ding material rather than car@@ ving it out ; materials engineering , which lets us design the behavior of materials in high resol@@ ution ; and syn@@ thetic biology , en@@ ab@@ ling us to design new biological func@@ tion@@ ality by ed@@ iting DNA .
And at the inter@@ section of these four fields , my team and I create .
Please meet the minds and hands of my students .
We design objects and products and structures and tools across sc@@ ales , from the lar@@ ge@@ -@@ scale , like this robo@@ tic arm with an 8@@ 0-@@ foot diam@@ eter reach with a vehic@@ ular base that will one day soon print entire buildings , to nan@@ o@@ scale graph@@ ics made entirely of gene@@ tically engine@@ ered micro@@ organisms that g@@ low in the dark .
Here we &apos;ve re@@ imagin@@ ed the mas@@ h@@ rab@@ i@@ ya , an arch@@ et@@ y@@ pe of ancient Arab@@ ic architecture , and created a screen where every ap@@ er@@ ture is uni@@ quel@@ y si@@ zed to shape the form of light and heat moving through it .
In our next project , we explore the possibility of creating a cape and sk@@ ir@@ t -- this was for a Paris fashion show with I@@ r@@ is van Her@@ pen -- like a second skin that are made of a single part , sti@@ ff at the con@@ tours , flex@@ ible around the wai@@ st .
To@@ gether with my long-term 3D printing collabor@@ ator S@@ tr@@ at@@ as@@ ys , we 3@@ D@@ -@@ prin@@ ted this cape and sk@@ ir@@ t with no se@@ ams between the cells , and I &apos;ll show more objects like it .
This hel@@ met comb@@ ines sti@@ ff and soft materials in 20@@ -@@ mic@@ r@@ on resol@@ ution .
This is the resol@@ ution of a human hair .
It &apos;s also the resol@@ ution of a C@@ T scanner .
That designers have access to such high-@@ resol@@ ution analy@@ tic and syn@@ thetic tools , en@@ ables to design products that fit not only the shape of our bodies , but also the physi@@ o@@ logical ma@@ k@@ eu@@ p of our tis@@ su@@ es .
N@@ ext , we designed an ac@@ ou@@ stic chair , a chair that would be at once struc@@ tural , comfortable and would also absor@@ b sound .
Pro@@ f@@ essor Car@@ ter , my collabor@@ ator , and I turned to nature for inspiration , and by designing this ir@@ regular surface pattern , it becomes sou@@ n@@ d-@@ absor@@ b@@ ent .
We prin@@ ted its surface out of 4@@ 4 different properties , v@@ ar@@ ying in ri@@ gi@@ d@@ ity , op@@ ac@@ ity and color , correspon@@ ding to pressure points on the human body .
I@@ ts surface , as in nature , v@@ aries its func@@ tion@@ ality not by ad@@ ding another material or another ass@@ em@@ bly , but by continu@@ ously and del@@ ic@@ ately v@@ ar@@ ying material property .
But is nature ide@@ al ?
Are there no parts in nature ?
I wasn &apos;t raised in a religious Je@@ wish home , but when I was young , my grandmother used to tell me stories from the He@@ bre@@ w Bible , and one of them stuck with me and came to define much of what I care about .
As she re@@ coun@@ ts : &quot; On the third day of C@@ re@@ ation , God comman@@ ds the Earth to grow a fru@@ it-@@ be@@ ar@@ ing fruit tree . &quot;
For this first fruit tree , there was to be no differ@@ enti@@ ation between tr@@ un@@ k , bran@@ ches , leaves and fruit .
The whole tree was a fruit .
Instead , the land grew trees that have bar@@ k and st@@ ems and f@@ lowers .
The land created a world made of parts .
I often ask myself , &quot; What would design be like if objects were made of a single part ?
Would we return to a better state of creation ? &quot;
So we looked for that bi@@ b@@ lic@@ al material , that fru@@ it-@@ be@@ ar@@ ing fruit tree kind of material , and we found it .
The secon@@ d-@@ most ab@@ un@@ dant bio@@ poly@@ mer on the planet is called chi@@ tin , and some 100 million tons of it are produced every year by organisms such as sh@@ ri@@ m@@ ps , cr@@ ab@@ s , s@@ cor@@ pi@@ ons and but@@ ter@@ flies .
We thought if we could tune its properties , we could generate structures that are multi@@ func@@ tional out of a single part .
So that &apos;s what we did .
We called L@@ eg@@ al S@@ ea@@ food -- we or@@ der@@ ed a bunch of sh@@ ri@@ mp shel@@ ls , we gr@@ ind@@ ed them and we produced ch@@ it@@ os@@ an pas@@ te .
By v@@ ar@@ ying chemical concentr@@ ations , we were able to achieve a wide arr@@ ay of properties -- from dark , sti@@ ff and op@@ aque , to light , soft and transparent .
In order to print the structures in large scale , we built a robo@@ tically controlled ex@@ tru@@ sion system with multiple no@@ zz@@ les .
The robot would v@@ ary material properties on the fly and create these 1@@ 2@@ -@@ foot@@ -@@ long structures made of a single material , 100 percent recycl@@ able .
When the parts are ready , they &apos;re left to dry and find a form natur@@ ally upon contact with air .
So why are we still designing with plas@@ tics ?
The air bu@@ b@@ bles that were a by@@ product of the printing process were used to cont@@ ain photo@@ syn@@ thetic micro@@ organisms that first appeared on our planet 3@@ .@@ 5 billion year ago , as we learned yesterday .
To@@ gether with our collabor@@ ators at Harvard and MIT , we em@@ bed@@ ded bacteria that were gene@@ tically engine@@ ered to rapidly capture carbon from the atmosphere and con@@ vert it into su@@ gar .
For the first time , we were able to generate structures that would se@@ am@@ less@@ ly transition from b@@ ea@@ m to mes@@ h , and if sc@@ aled even larger , to windo@@ ws .
A fru@@ it-@@ be@@ ar@@ ing fruit tree .
Wor@@ king with an ancient material , one of the first life@@ forms on the planet , pl@@ enty of water and a little bit of syn@@ thetic biology , we were able to transform a structure made of sh@@ ri@@ mp shel@@ ls into an architecture that behav@@ es like a tree .
And here &apos;s the best part : for objects designed to bio@@ de@@ grade , put them in the sea , and they will nour@@ ish marine life ; place them in soil , and they will help grow a tree .
The setting for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system .
We looked for the possibility of creating life@@ -@@ sust@@ aining clo@@ thing for inter@@ plan@@ et@@ ary voy@@ ages .
To do that , we needed to cont@@ ain bacteria and be able to control their flow .
So like the peri@@ o@@ di@@ c table , we came up with our own table of the elements : new life@@ forms that were compu@@ t@@ ation@@ ally grown , addi@@ tively manufactu@@ red and biolog@@ ically augment@@ ed .
I like to think of syn@@ thetic biology as liqui@@ d al@@ chem@@ y , only instead of trans@@ mu@@ ting pre@@ ci@@ ous met@@ als , you &apos;re syn@@ thes@@ izing new biological func@@ tion@@ ality inside very small ch@@ ann@@ els .
It &apos;s called micro@@ flu@@ i@@ dic@@ s .
We 3@@ D@@ -@@ prin@@ ted our own ch@@ ann@@ els in order to control the flow of these liqui@@ d bacter@@ ial cultures .
In our first piece of clo@@ thing , we combin@@ ed two micro@@ organisms .
The first is cy@@ an@@ ob@@ acter@@ ia .
It lives in our oceans and in fres@@ h@@ water pon@@ ds .
And the second , E@@ . col@@ i , the bacter@@ ium that in@@ hab@@ its the human g@@ ut .
One conver@@ ts light into su@@ gar , the other consu@@ mes that su@@ gar and produ@@ ces bio@@ fu@@ els useful for the built environment .
Now , these two micro@@ organisms never interact in nature .
In fact , they never met each other .
They &apos;ve been here , engine@@ ered for the first time , to have a relationship inside a piece of clo@@ thing .
Think of it as evolution not by natural sel@@ ection , but evolution by design .
In order to cont@@ ain these relationships , we &apos;ve created a single chan@@ nel that res@@ em@@ bles the dig@@ es@@ tive tr@@ act , that will help flow these bacteria and al@@ ter their function along the way .
We then started growing these ch@@ ann@@ els on the human body , v@@ ar@@ ying material properties according to the des@@ i@@ red func@@ tion@@ ality .
Where we wanted more photo@@ syn@@ thesis , we would design more transparent ch@@ ann@@ els .
This w@@ ear@@ able dig@@ es@@ tive system , when it &apos;s stre@@ t@@ ched end to end , sp@@ ans 60 meters .
This is half the l@@ ength of a football field , and 10 times as long as our small int@@ est@@ ines .
And here it is for the first time un@@ ve@@ il@@ ed at TED -- our first photo@@ syn@@ thetic w@@ ear@@ able , liqui@@ d ch@@ ann@@ els glo@@ wing with life inside a w@@ ear@@ able clo@@ thing .
Thank you .
Mary S@@ hel@@ ley said , &quot; We are un@@ fashi@@ oned creatures , but only half made up . &quot;
What if design could provide that other half ?
What if we could create structures that would aug@@ ment living matter ?
What if we could create personal micro@@ biom@@ es that would s@@ can our sk@@ ins , re@@ pair dam@@ aged tissue and sust@@ ain our bodies ?
Think of this as a form of ed@@ ited biology .
This entire collection , W@@ ander@@ ers , that was named after planets , was not to me really about fashion per se , but it provi@@ ded an opportunity to spec@@ ul@@ ate about the future of our race on our planet and beyond , to combine scientific insi@@ ght with lots of myst@@ ery and to move away from the age of the machine to a new age of sym@@ bio@@ sis between our bodies , the micro@@ organisms that we in@@ hab@@ it ,
our products and even our buildings .
I call this material eco@@ logy .
To do this , we always need to return back to nature .
By now , you know that a 3D prin@@ ter prin@@ ts material in lay@@ ers .
You also know that nature doesn &apos;t .
It gro@@ ws . It ad@@ ds with sophistic@@ ation .
This sil@@ k@@ wor@@ m co@@ co@@ on , for example , creates a highly sophistic@@ ated architecture , a home inside which to met@@ am@@ orph@@ is@@ ize .
No addi@@ tive manufactu@@ ring today gets even close to this level of sophistic@@ ation .
It does so by combin@@ ing not two materials , but two prot@@ e@@ ins in different concentr@@ ations .
One acts as the structure , the other is the g@@ lue , or the ma@@ tri@@ x , holding those fi@@ bers together .
And this happens across sc@@ ales .
The sil@@ k@@ wor@@ m first atta@@ ches itself to the environment -- it creates a ten@@ si@@ le structure -- and it then starts sp@@ inning a com@@ pres@@ sive co@@ co@@ on .
T@@ en@@ sion and com@@ pression , the two forces of life , manifes@@ ted in a single material .
In order to better understand how this complex process works , we glu@@ ed a tiny earth mag@@ net to the head of a sil@@ k@@ wor@@ m , to the sp@@ in@@ ner@@ et .
We placed it inside a box with mag@@ ne@@ tic sens@@ ors , and that allowed us to create this 3@@ -@@ dimensional point cloud and visu@@ alize the complex architecture of the sil@@ k@@ wor@@ m co@@ co@@ on .
However , when we placed the sil@@ k@@ wor@@ m on a fl@@ at pat@@ ch , not inside a box , we realized it would sp@@ in a fl@@ at co@@ co@@ on and it would still health@@ ily met@@ am@@ orph@@ is@@ ize .
So we started designing different environments , different sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ds , and we discovered that the shape , the com@@ position , the structure of the co@@ co@@ on , was directly inform@@ ed by the environment .
S@@ il@@ k@@ wor@@ ms are often bo@@ il@@ ed to death inside their co@@ co@@ ons , their sil@@ k un@@ rav@@ eled and used in the tex@@ tile industry .
We realized that designing these t@@ empl@@ ates allowed us to give shape to ra@@ w sil@@ k without bo@@ iling a single co@@ co@@ on .
They would health@@ ily met@@ am@@ orph@@ is@@ ize , and we would be able to create these things .
So we sc@@ aled this process up to architec@@ tural scale .
We had a robot sp@@ in the t@@ empl@@ ate out of sil@@ k , and we placed it on our site .
We knew sil@@ k@@ wor@@ ms migr@@ ated toward dar@@ ker and col@@ der areas , so we used a sun path diag@@ ram to reve@@ al the distribution of light and heat on our structure .
We then created holes , or ap@@ er@@ tures , that would lock in the r@@ ays of light and heat , distribu@@ ting those sil@@ k@@ wor@@ ms on the structure .
We were ready to rece@@ ive the cat@@ er@@ p@@ ill@@ ars .
We or@@ der@@ ed 6@@ ,@@ 500 sil@@ k@@ wor@@ ms from an online sil@@ k farm .
And after four weeks of fe@@ eding , they were ready to sp@@ in with us .
We placed them carefully at the bottom ri@@ m of the sc@@ aff@@ old , and as they sp@@ in they pu@@ p@@ ate , they mate , they lay eg@@ gs , and life begins all over again -- just like us but much , much shor@@ ter .
Bu@@ cky F@@ ul@@ ler said that tension is the great integr@@ ity , and he was right .
As they sp@@ in biological sil@@ k over robo@@ tically sp@@ un sil@@ k , they give this entire p@@ av@@ ili@@ on its integr@@ ity .
And over two to three weeks , 6@@ ,@@ 500 sil@@ k@@ wor@@ ms sp@@ in 6@@ ,@@ 500 kilometers .
In a curious symme@@ try , this is also the l@@ ength of the S@@ il@@ k Ro@@ ad .
The mo@@ ths , after they h@@ atch , produce 1.@@ 5 million eg@@ gs .
This could be used for 250 addi@@ tional p@@ av@@ ili@@ ons for the future .
So here they are , the two world@@ vie@@ ws .
One sp@@ ins sil@@ k out of a robo@@ tic arm , the other f@@ ills in the g@@ aps .
If the final fronti@@ er of design is to brea@@ the life into the products and the buildings around us , to form a two-@@ material eco@@ logy , then designers must un@@ ite these two world@@ vie@@ ws .
Which brings us back , of course , to the beginning .
Here &apos;s to a new age of design , a new age of creation , that takes us from a natu@@ re-@@ inspired design to a design@@ -@@ inspired nature , and that dem@@ ands of us for the first time that we mother nature .
Thank you .
Thank you very much . Thank you .
R@@ aise your hand if you &apos;ve ever been asked the question &quot; What do you want to be when you grow up ? &quot;
Now if you had to guess , how old would you say you were when you were first asked this question ?
You can just hold up fin@@ gers .
Three . F@@ ive . Three . F@@ ive . F@@ ive . OK .
Now , raise your hand if the question &quot; What do you want to be when you grow up ? &quot;
has ever caused you any anxi@@ ety .
An@@ y anxi@@ ety at all .
I &apos;m someone who &apos;s never been able to answer the question &quot; What do you want to be when you grow up ? &quot;
See , the problem wasn &apos;t that I didn &apos;t have any interes@@ ts -- it &apos;s that I had too many .
In high school , I liked English and math and art and I built web@@ sites and I played gu@@ it@@ ar in a pun@@ k band called Fr@@ ustr@@ ated T@@ ele@@ phone O@@ per@@ ator .
Maybe you &apos;ve heard of us .
This continu@@ ed after high school , and at a certain point , I began to notice this pattern in myself where I would become interested in an area and I would di@@ ve in , become all@@ -@@ consum@@ ed , and I &apos;d get to be pretty good at whatever it was , and then I would hit this point where I &apos;d start to get bo@@ red .
And usually I would try and pers@@ ist anyway , because I had already dev@@ ot@@ ed so much time and energy and sometimes money into this field .
But eventually this sense of bo@@ re@@ dom , this feeling of , like , yeah , I got this , this isn &apos;t challeng@@ ing anymore -- it would get to be too much .
And I would have to let it go .
But then I would become interested in something else , something totally un@@ related , and I would di@@ ve into that , and become all@@ -@@ consum@@ ed , and I &apos;d be like , &quot; Yes ! I found my thing , &quot; and then I would hit this point again where I &apos;d start to get bo@@ red .
And eventually , I would let it go .
But then I would discover something new and totally different , and I would di@@ ve into that .
This pattern caused me a lot of anxi@@ ety , for two reasons .
The first was that I wasn &apos;t sure how I was going to turn any of this into a career .
I thought that I would eventually have to pick one thing , den@@ y all of my other pas@@ sions , and just res@@ ign myself to being bo@@ red .
The other reason it caused me so much anxi@@ ety was a little bit more personal .
I worried that there was something wrong with this , and something wrong with me for being un@@ able to stick with anything .
I worried that I was afraid of commit@@ ment , or that I was sc@@ at@@ tered , or that I was self-@@ s@@ ab@@ ot@@ aging , afraid of my own success .
If you can rel@@ ate to my story and to these feelings , I &apos;d like you to ask yourself a question that I wish I had asked myself back then .
As@@ k yourself where you learned to as@@ sign the meaning of wrong or ab@@ normal to doing many things .
I &apos;ll tell you where you learned it : you learned it from the culture .
We are first asked the question &quot; What do you want to be when you grow up ? &quot;
when we &apos;re about five years old .
And the truth is that no one really car@@ es what you say when you &apos;re that age .
It &apos;s considered an inno@@ cu@@ ous question , posed to little kids to el@@ ic@@ it cu@@ te re@@ pli@@ es , like , &quot; I want to be an astr@@ on@@ aut , &quot; or &quot; I want to be a ball@@ er@@ ina , &quot; or &quot; I want to be a pir@@ ate . &quot;
In@@ sert H@@ allo@@ ween co@@ stu@@ me here .
But this question gets asked of us again and again as we get older in various forms -- for instance , high school students might get asked what major they &apos;re going to pick in college .
And at some point , &quot; What do you want to be when you grow up ? &quot;
goes from being the cu@@ te exercise it once was to the thing that kee@@ ps us up at night .
Why ?
See , while this question insp@@ ires kids to dream about what they could be , it does not inspire them to dream about all that they could be .
In fact , it does just the opposite , because when someone asks you what you want to be , you can &apos;t re@@ ply with 20 different things , though well-@@ meaning adults will likely chu@@ ck@@ le and be like , &quot; Oh , how cu@@ te , but you can &apos;t be a vi@@ o@@ lin ma@@ ker and a psycho@@ logist .
You have to choose . &quot;
This is Dr. Bob Chil@@ ds -- and he &apos;s a lu@@ th@@ ier and psycho@@ therap@@ ist .
And this is A@@ my N@@ g , a magazine ed@@ it@@ or turned illustr@@ ator , entrepreneur , teacher and creative direc@@ tor .
But most kids don &apos;t hear about people like this .
All they hear is that they &apos;re going to have to choose .
But it &apos;s more than that .
The notion of the nar@@ ro@@ w@@ ly focused life is highly rom@@ anti@@ ci@@ zed in our culture .
It &apos;s this idea of des@@ tiny or the one true calling , the idea that we each have one great thing we are meant to do during our time on this earth , and you need to figure out what that thing is and dev@@ ote your life to it .
But what if you &apos;re someone who isn &apos;t wi@@ red this way ?
What if there are a lot of different subj@@ ects that you &apos;re curious about , and many different things you want to do ?
Well , there is no room for someone like you in this fr@@ am@@ ework .
And so you might feel alone .
You might feel like you don &apos;t have a purpose .
And you might feel like there &apos;s something wrong with you .
There &apos;s nothing wrong with you .
What you are is a multi@@ potenti@@ al@@ ite .
A multi@@ potenti@@ al@@ ite is someone with many interes@@ ts and creative pur@@ su@@ its .
It &apos;s a mou@@ th@@ ful to say .
It might help if you break it up into three parts : mul@@ ti , potential , and ite .
You can also use one of the other terms that conn@@ ote the same idea , such as poly@@ math , the R@@ en@@ aiss@@ ance person .
Actually , during the R@@ en@@ aiss@@ ance period , it was considered the ide@@ al to be well-@@ vers@@ ed in multiple discipl@@ ines .
Bar@@ bar@@ a S@@ her ref@@ ers to us as &quot; scann@@ ers . &quot;
U@@ se wh@@ i@@ ch@@ ever term you like , or invent your own .
I have to say I find it sort of f@@ itting that as a community , we cannot agree on a single identity .
It &apos;s easy to see your multi@@ potenti@@ ality as a lim@@ itation or an aff@@ lic@@ tion that you need to over@@ come .
But what I &apos;ve learned through speaking with people and writing about these ideas on my website , is that there are some tremendous str@@ eng@@ ths to being this way .
Here are three multi@@ potenti@@ al@@ ite super po@@ wers .
One : idea syn@@ thesis .
That is , combin@@ ing two or more fields and creating something new at the inter@@ section .
Sh@@ a H@@ wan@@ g and R@@ ach@@ el B@@ in@@ x drew from their shared interes@@ ts in carto@@ graph@@ y , data visu@@ alization , travel , mathematics and design , when they f@@ ounded M@@ es@@ h@@ u .
M@@ es@@ h@@ u is a company that creates cu@@ st@@ om ge@@ ograp@@ hic@@ all@@ y-@@ inspired je@@ wel@@ ry .
Sh@@ a and R@@ ach@@ el came up with this unique idea not despite , but because of their ec@@ lec@@ tic mi@@ x of skills and experiences .
In@@ nov@@ ation happens at the inter@@ sec@@ tions .
That &apos;s where the new ideas come from .
And multi@@ potenti@@ al@@ ites , with all of their back@@ gr@@ ounds , are able to access a lot of these points of inter@@ section .
The second multi@@ potenti@@ al@@ ite super@@ power is rap@@ id learning .
When multi@@ potenti@@ al@@ ites become interested in something , we go hard .
We observe everything we can get our hands on .
We &apos;re also used to being beg@@ in@@ ners , because we &apos;ve been beg@@ in@@ ners so many times in the past , and this means that we &apos;re less afraid of trying new things and ste@@ pping out of our com@@ fort zones .
What &apos;s more , many skills are trans@@ fer@@ able across discipl@@ ines , and we bring everything we &apos;ve learned to every new area we pur@@ sue , so we &apos;re rar@@ ely starting from scr@@ atch .
Nor@@ a D@@ un@@ n is a ful@@ l@@ -@@ time trav@@ el@@ er and fre@@ el@@ ance writer .
As a child concert pi@@ an@@ ist , she hon@@ ed an incredible ability to develop muscle memory .
Now , she &apos;s the fas@@ test ty@@ p@@ ist she knows .
Be@@ fore becoming a writer , Nor@@ a was a financial plann@@ er .
She had to learn the fin@@ er mechan@@ ics of s@@ ales when she was starting her practice , and this sk@@ ill now helps her write comp@@ elling pit@@ ches to ed@@ it@@ ors .
It is rar@@ ely a waste of time to pur@@ sue something you &apos;re dra@@ wn to , even if you end up qu@@ itting .
You might apply that knowledge in a different field entirely , in a way that you couldn &apos;t have anticip@@ ated .
The third multi@@ potenti@@ al@@ ite super@@ power is adap@@ t@@ ability ; that is , the ability to mor@@ p@@ h into whatever you need to be in a given situation .
A@@ be C@@ a@@ ju@@ do is sometimes a video direc@@ tor , sometimes a web designer , sometimes a K@@ ick@@ star@@ ter consul@@ tant , sometimes a teacher , and sometimes , appar@@ ently , James B@@ ond .
He &apos;s valuable because he does good work .
He &apos;s even more valuable because he can take on various ro@@ les , depend@@ ing on his clients &apos; needs .
F@@ ast Com@@ p@@ any magazine identi@@ fied adap@@ t@@ ability as the single most important sk@@ ill to develop in order to th@@ ri@@ ve in the 21@@ st century .
The economic world is changing so quickly and un@@ predic@@ tab@@ ly that it is the individuals and organizations that can pi@@ vo@@ t in order to meet the needs of the market that are really going to th@@ ri@@ ve .
I@@ de@@ a syn@@ thesis , rap@@ id learning and adap@@ t@@ ability : three skills that multi@@ potenti@@ al@@ ites are very a@@ de@@ pt at , and three skills that they might lose if pres@@ su@@ red to nar@@ row their focus .
As a society , we have a v@@ ested interest in encour@@ aging multi@@ potenti@@ al@@ ites to be themselves .
We have a lot of complex , multi@@ dimensional problems in the world right now , and we need creative , ou@@ t-@@ of@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ box thin@@ kers to t@@ ack@@ le them .
Now , let &apos;s say that you are , in your heart , a speci@@ alis@@ t .
You came out of the wom@@ b knowing you wanted to be a pe@@ di@@ atri@@ c neuro@@ surge@@ on .
Don &apos;t worry -- there &apos;s nothing wrong with you , either .
In fact , some of the best te@@ ams are com@@ pris@@ ed of a speci@@ alis@@ t and multi@@ potenti@@ al@@ ite pai@@ red together .
The speci@@ alis@@ t can di@@ ve in deep and impl@@ ement ideas , while the multi@@ potenti@@ al@@ ite brings a bre@@ ad@@ th of knowledge to the project .
It &apos;s a beautiful part@@ ner@@ ship .
But we should all be designing lives and care@@ ers that are al@@ ign@@ ed with how we &apos;re wi@@ red .
And s@@ ad@@ ly , multi@@ potenti@@ al@@ ites are larg@@ ely being encour@@ aged simply to be more like their speci@@ alis@@ t pe@@ ers .
So with that said , if there is one thing you take away from this talk , I hope that it is this : embr@@ ace your inner w@@ ir@@ ing , whatever that may be .
If you &apos;re a speci@@ alis@@ t at heart , then by all means , speci@@ alize .
That is where you &apos;ll do your best work .
But to the multi@@ potenti@@ al@@ ites in the room , including those of you who may have just realized in the last 12 minutes that you are one -- to you I say : embr@@ ace your many pas@@ sions .
F@@ ol@@ low your curios@@ ity down those rab@@ bit holes .
Ex@@ pl@@ ore your inter@@ sec@@ tions .
Em@@ br@@ ac@@ ing our inner w@@ ir@@ ing leads to a happ@@ ier , more authenti@@ c life .
And perhaps more importantly -- multi@@ potenti@@ al@@ ites , the world needs us .
Thank you .
In the year 19@@ 0@@ 1 , a woman called Au@@ g@@ us@@ te was taken to a medical as@@ y@@ lu@@ m in Fr@@ ank@@ fur@@ t .
Au@@ g@@ us@@ te was del@@ u@@ si@@ onal and couldn &apos;t remember even the most basic details of her life .
Her doctor was called A@@ lo@@ is .
A@@ lo@@ is didn &apos;t know how to help Au@@ g@@ us@@ te , but he watched over her until , s@@ ad@@ ly , she passed away in 19@@ 0@@ 6 .
After she died , A@@ lo@@ is perform@@ ed an aut@@ op@@ s@@ y and found strange pl@@ a@@ ques and t@@ angles in Au@@ g@@ us@@ te &apos;s brain -- the li@@ kes of which he &apos;d never seen before .
Now here &apos;s the even more stri@@ king thing .
If Au@@ g@@ us@@ te had instead been alive today , we could offer her no more help than A@@ lo@@ is was able to 1@@ 14 years ago .
A@@ lo@@ is was Dr. A@@ lo@@ is Alzheimer .
And Au@@ g@@ us@@ te D@@ eter was the first patient to be diagno@@ sed with what we now call Alzheimer &apos;s disease .
Since 19@@ 0@@ 1 , medicine has advanced great@@ ly .
We &apos;ve discovered antibio@@ tics and vacc@@ ines to protect us from inf@@ ections , many treat@@ ments for cancer , anti@@ re@@ tro@@ vir@@ als for HIV , stat@@ ins for heart disease and much more .
But we &apos;ve made essentially no progress at all in tre@@ ating Alzheimer &apos;s disease .
I &apos;m part of a team of scientists who has been working to find a cure for Alzheimer &apos;s for over a decade .
So I think about this all the time .
Alzheimer &apos;s now aff@@ ects 40 million people worldwide .
But by 20@@ 50 , it will affect 150 million people -- which , by the way , will include many of you .
If you &apos;re hop@@ ing to live to be 85 or older , your chance of getting Alzheimer &apos;s will be almost one in two .
In other words , od@@ ds are you &apos;ll spend your gol@@ den years either suffering from Alzheimer &apos;s or helping to look after a friend or loved one with Alzheimer &apos;s .
Al@@ ready in the United States alone , Alzheimer &apos;s care costs 200 billion dollars every year .
One out of every five Medic@@ are dollars get spent on Alzheimer &apos;s .
It is today the most expensive disease , and costs are proj@@ ected to increase fi@@ ve@@ fold by 20@@ 50 , as the baby bo@@ om@@ er generation ages .
It may surprise you that , put simply , Alzheimer &apos;s is one of the biggest medical and social challenges of our generation .
But we &apos;ve done relatively little to address it .
Today , of the top 10 causes of death worldwide , Alzheimer &apos;s is the only one we cannot prevent , cure or even slow down .
We understand less about the science of Alzheimer &apos;s than other diseases because we &apos;ve inv@@ ested less time and money into resear@@ ching it .
The US government sp@@ ends 10 times more every year on cancer research than on Alzheimer &apos;s despite the fact that Alzheimer &apos;s costs us more and causes a similar number of dea@@ ths each year as cancer .
The lack of resources st@@ ems from a more fundamental cause : a lack of awareness .
Because here &apos;s what few people know but everyone should : Alzheimer &apos;s is a disease , and we can cure it .
For most of the past 1@@ 14 years , everyone , including scientists , mis@@ ta@@ k@@ enly conf@@ used Alzheimer &apos;s with aging .
We thought that becoming sen@@ ile was a normal and in@@ ev@@ itable part of getting old .
But we only have to look at a picture of a healthy aged brain compared to the brain of an Alzheimer &apos;s patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease .
As well as tr@@ ig@@ g@@ ering sev@@ ere loss of memory and mental abilities , the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer &apos;s signific@@ antly re@@ du@@ ces life expect@@ ancy and is always fat@@ al .
Rem@@ ember Dr. Alzheimer found strange pl@@ a@@ ques and t@@ angles in Au@@ g@@ us@@ te &apos;s brain a century ago .
For almost a century , we didn &apos;t know much about these .
Today we know they &apos;re made from protein molecules .
You can imagine a protein molecule as a piece of paper that normally fol@@ ds into an el@@ abor@@ ate piece of origami .
There are spo@@ ts on the paper that are stic@@ ky .
And when it fol@@ ds correc@@ tly , these stic@@ ky bits end up on the inside .
But sometimes things go wrong , and some stic@@ ky bits are on the outside .
This causes the protein molecules to stick to each other , form@@ ing clu@@ m@@ ps that eventually become large pl@@ a@@ ques and t@@ angles .
That &apos;s what we see in the brains of Alzheimer &apos;s patients .
We &apos;ve spent the past 10 years at the University of Cam@@ bridge trying to understand how this mal@@ function works .
There are many steps , and identi@@ fying which step to try to block is complex -- like def@@ using a bom@@ b .
C@@ ut@@ ting one w@@ ire might do nothing .
C@@ ut@@ ting others might make the bom@@ b explore .
We have to find the right step to block , and then create a drug that does it .
Un@@ til recently , we for the most part have been cut@@ ting wi@@ res and hop@@ ing for the best .
But now we &apos;ve got together a di@@ verse group of people -- medic@@ s , bio@@ logists , gene@@ tic@@ ists , chem@@ ists , physi@@ cis@@ ts , engineers and mathemati@@ ci@@ ans .
And together , we &apos;ve managed to identify a critical step in the process and are now testing a new class of drugs which would specifically block this step and stop the disease .
Now let me show you some of our lat@@ est results .
No one outside of our lab has seen these yet .
Let &apos;s look at some videos of what happened when we tes@@ ted these new drugs in wor@@ ms .
So these are healthy wor@@ ms , and you can see they &apos;re moving around normally .
These wor@@ ms , on the other hand , have protein molecules stic@@ king together inside them -- like humans with Alzheimer &apos;s .
And you can see they &apos;re clearly sick .
But if we give our new drugs to these wor@@ ms at an early stage , then we see that they &apos;re healthy , and they live a normal lif@@ esp@@ an .
This is just an initi@@ al positive result , but research like this shows us that Alzheimer &apos;s is a disease that we can understand and we can cure .
After 1@@ 14 years of waiting , there &apos;s finally real hope for what can be achiev@@ ed in the next 10 or 20 years .
But to grow that hope , to finally beat Alzheimer &apos;s , we need help .
This isn &apos;t about scientists like me -- it &apos;s about you .
We need you to raise awareness that Alzheimer &apos;s is a disease and that if we try , we can beat it .
In the case of other diseases , patients and their families have led the charge for more research and put pressure on governments , the pharmaceu@@ tical industry , scientists and regul@@ ators .
That was essential for adv@@ ancing treatment for HIV in the late 198@@ 0s .
Today , we see that same drive to beat cancer .
But Alzheimer &apos;s patients are often un@@ able to speak up for themselves .
And their families , the hidden victims , car@@ ing for their loved ones night and day , are often too wor@@ n out to go out and ad@@ voc@@ ate for change .
So , it really is down to you .
Alzheimer &apos;s isn &apos;t , for the most part , a genetic disease .
Every@@ one with a brain is at risk .
Today , there are 40 million patients like Au@@ g@@ us@@ te , who can &apos;t create the change they need for themselves .
Hel@@ p speak up for them , and help demand a cure .
Thank you .
I published this article in the New York Times Mo@@ der@@ n Lo@@ ve col@@ um@@ n in Jan@@ u@@ ary of this year .
&quot; To F@@ all in Lo@@ ve With Any@@ one , Do This . &quot;
And the article is about a psycho@@ logical study designed to create roman@@ tic love in the labor@@ atory , and my own experience trying the study myself one night last summer .
So the proce@@ dure is fairly simple : two str@@ angers take turns asking each other 3@@ 6 increasingly personal questions and then they st@@ are into each other &apos;s eyes without speaking for four minutes .
So here are a couple of sam@@ ple questions .
Num@@ ber 12 : If you could wake up tomorrow having g@@ ained any one quality or ability , what would it be ?
Num@@ ber 28 : When did you last cr@@ y in front of another person ?
By yourself ?
As you can see , they really do get more personal as they go along .
Num@@ ber 30 , I really like this one : T@@ ell your partner what you like about them ; be very honest this time , saying things you might not say to someone you just met .
So when I first came across this study a few years earlier , one detail really stuck out to me , and that was the ru@@ mor that two of the participants had gotten married six months later , and they &apos;d invited the entire lab to the cer@@ em@@ ony .
So I was of course very s@@ ke@@ p@@ tical about this process of just manufactu@@ ring roman@@ tic love , but of course I was intrig@@ u@@ ed .
And when I got the chance to try this study myself , with someone I knew but not particularly well , I wasn &apos;t exp@@ ecting to fall in love .
But then we did , and -- And I thought it made a good story , so I sent it to the Mo@@ der@@ n Lo@@ ve col@@ um@@ n a few months later .
Now , this was published in Jan@@ u@@ ary , and now it is Au@@ g@@ ust , so I &apos;m gu@@ essing that some of you are probably wondering , are we still together ?
And the reason I think you might be wondering this is because I have been asked this question again and again and again for the past seven months .
And this question is really what I want to talk about today .
But let &apos;s come back to it .
So the week before the article came out , I was very nervous .
I had been working on a book about love stories so I had gotten used to writing about my own experiences with roman@@ tic love on my blog .
But a blog pos@@ t might get a couple hundred vie@@ ws at the most , and those were usually just my Facebook friends , and I figured my article in the New York Times would probably get a few thousand vie@@ ws .
And that felt like a lot of attention on a relatively new relationship .
But as it turned out , I had no idea .
So the article was published online on a Fri@@ day even@@ ing , and by Satur@@ day , this had happened to the traffic on my blog .
And by S@@ un@@ day , both the Today S@@ how and Good Mor@@ ning America had called .
Wi@@ thin a month , the article would rece@@ ive over 8 million vie@@ ws , and I was , to say the least , under@@ prepar@@ ed for this sort of attention .
It &apos;s one thing to work up the confidence to write hon@@ est@@ ly about your experiences with love , but it is another thing to discover that your love life has made international news -- and to realize that people across the world are gen@@ u@@ in@@ ely inv@@ ested in the status of your new relationship .
And when people called or em@@ ailed , which they did every day for weeks , they always asked the same question first : are you guys still together ?
In fact , as I was prepar@@ ing this talk , I did a quick search of my email in@@ box for the phrase &quot; Are you still together ? &quot;
and several messages po@@ pped up immediately .
They were from students and journalis@@ ts and friend@@ ly str@@ angers like this one .
I did radio intervie@@ ws and they asked .
I even gave a talk , and one woman sh@@ ou@@ ted up to the stage , &quot; Hey Mand@@ y , where &apos;s your bo@@ y@@ friend ? &quot;
And I prom@@ p@@ tly turned bright red .
I understand that this is part of the deal .
If you write about your relationship in an international newsp@@ aper , you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it .
But I just wasn &apos;t prepar@@ ed for the sc@@ ope of the response .
The 3@@ 6 questions seem to have taken on a life of their own .
In fact , the New York Times published a fol@@ low-@@ up article for Val@@ ent@@ ine &apos;s Day , which fe@@ atu@@ red read@@ ers &apos; experiences of trying the study themselves , with v@@ ar@@ ying degrees of success .
So my first impul@@ se in the face of all of this attention was to become very prot@@ ective of my own relationship .
I said no to every requ@@ est for the two of us to do a media appear@@ ance together .
I turned down TV intervie@@ ws , and I said no to every requ@@ est for photos of the two us .
I think I was afraid that we would become in@@ adver@@ tent ic@@ ons for the process of fall@@ ing in love , a position I did not at all feel quali@@ fied for .
And I get it : people didn &apos;t just want to know if the study worked , they wanted to know if it really worked : that is , if it was capable of producing love that would last , not just a fl@@ ing , but real love , sustainable love .
But this was a question I didn &apos;t feel capable of ans@@ wer@@ ing .
My own relationship was only a few months old , and I felt like people were asking the wrong question in the first place .
What would knowing whether or not we were still together really tell them ?
If the answer was no , would it make the experience of doing these 3@@ 6 questions any less wor@@ th@@ while ?
Dr. Ar@@ thu@@ r Ar@@ on first wrote about these questions in this study here in 199@@ 7 , and here , the resear@@ cher &apos;s goal was not to produce roman@@ tic love .
Instead , they wanted to fo@@ ster inter@@ personal clo@@ sen@@ ess among college students , by using what Ar@@ on called &quot; sust@@ ained , es@@ cal@@ ating , reci@@ proc@@ al , person@@ alis@@ tic self-@@ dis@@ clo@@ sure . &quot;
S@@ ounds roman@@ tic , doesn &apos;t it ?
But the study did work .
The participants did feel closer after doing it , and several sub@@ se@@ quent studies have also used Ar@@ on &apos;s fast friends proto@@ co@@ l as a way to quickly create trust and in@@ tim@@ acy between str@@ angers .
They &apos;ve used it between members of the police and members of community , and they &apos;ve used it between people of oppos@@ ing political ide@@ o@@ logi@@ es .
The original version of the story , the one that I tried last summer , that pairs the personal questions with four minutes of eye contact , was refer@@ enced in this article , but unfortunately it was never published .
So a few months ago , I was giving a talk at a small liber@@ al arts college , and a student came up to me after@@ wards and he said , kind of sh@@ y@@ ly , &quot; So , I tried your study , and it didn &apos;t work . &quot;
He seemed a little my@@ sti@@ fied by this .
&quot; You mean , you didn &apos;t fall in love with the person you did it with ? &quot; I asked .
&quot; Well ... &quot; He p@@ aus@@ ed .
&quot; I think she just wants to be friends . &quot;
&quot; But did you become better friends ? &quot; I asked .
&quot; Did you feel like you got to really know each other after doing the study ? &quot;
He no@@ d@@ ded .
&quot; So , then it worked , &quot; I said .
I don &apos;t think this is the answer he was looking for .
In fact , I don &apos;t think this is the answer that any of us are looking for when it comes to love .
I first came across this study when I was 29 and I was going through a really difficult break@@ up .
I had been in the relationship since I was 20 , which was basically my entire adult life , and he was my first real love , and I had no idea how or if I could make a life without him .
So I turned to science .
I resear@@ ched everything I could find about the science of roman@@ tic love , and I think I was hop@@ ing that it might somehow in@@ o@@ cul@@ ate me from hear@@ ta@@ che .
I don &apos;t know if I realized this at the time -- I thought I was just doing research for this book I was writing -- but it seems really obvious in re@@ tro@@ sp@@ ect .
I hop@@ ed that if I arm@@ ed myself with the knowledge of roman@@ tic love , I might never have to feel as terrible and lon@@ ely as I did then .
And all this knowledge has been useful in some ways .
I am more patient with love . I am more rel@@ ax@@ ed .
I am more confi@@ dent about asking for what I want .
But I can also see myself more clearly , and I can see that what I want is sometimes more than can reas@@ on@@ ably be asked for .
What I want from love is a gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ e , not just that I am loved today and that I will be loved tomorrow , but that I will continue to be loved by the person I love in@@ definitely .
Maybe it &apos;s this possibility of a gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ e that people were really asking about when they wanted to know if we were still together .
So the story that the media told about the 3@@ 6 questions was that there might be a shor@@ t@@ cut to fall@@ ing in love .
There might be a way to somehow mi@@ ti@@ g@@ ate some of the risk involved , and this is a very appe@@ aling story , because fall@@ ing in love feels amazing , but it &apos;s also terri@@ fying .
The moment you ad@@ mit to lo@@ ving someone , you ad@@ mit to having a lot to lose , and it &apos;s true that these questions do provide a mechan@@ ism for getting to know someone quickly , which is also a mechan@@ ism for being known , and I think this is the thing that most of us really want from love : to be known , to be seen , to be understood .
But I think when it comes to love , we are too willing to accept the short version of the story .
The version of the story that asks , &quot; Are you still together ? &quot;
and is content with a yes or no answer .
So rather than that question , I would propose we ask some more difficult questions , questions like : How do you decide who des@@ er@@ ves your love and who does not ?
How do you stay in love when things get difficult , and how do you know when to just cut and run ?
How do you live with the doub@@ t that in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably cre@@ e@@ ps into every relationship , or even harder , how do you live with your partner &apos;s doub@@ t ?
I don &apos;t necessarily know the answers to these questions , but I think they &apos;re an important start at having a more thou@@ ght@@ ful conversation about what it means to love someone .
So , if you want it , the short version of the story of my relationship is this : a year ago , an acqu@@ ain@@ t@@ ance and I did a study designed to create roman@@ tic love , and we fell in love , and we are still together , and I am so gl@@ ad .
But fall@@ ing in love is not the same thing as st@@ aying in love .
F@@ all@@ ing in love is the easy part .
So at the end of my article , I wrote , &quot; Lo@@ ve didn &apos;t happen to us .
We &apos;re in love because we each made the choice to be . &quot;
And I cr@@ in@@ ge a little when I read that now , not because it isn &apos;t true , but because at the time , I really hadn &apos;t considered everything that was cont@@ ained in that choice .
I didn &apos;t consider how many times we would each have to make that choice , and how many times I will continue to have to make that choice without knowing whether or not he will always choose me .
I want it to be enough to have asked and ans@@ wer@@ ed 3@@ 6 questions , and to have cho@@ sen to love someone so gener@@ ous and kind and fun and to have broad@@ c@@ ast that choice in the biggest newsp@@ aper in America .
But what I have done instead is turn my relationship into the kind of my@@ th I don &apos;t quite believe in .
And what I want , what perhaps I will spend my life wan@@ ting , is for that my@@ th to be true .
I want the happy ending impli@@ ed by the ti@@ tle to my article , which is , in@@ cident@@ ally , the only part of the article that I didn &apos;t actually write .
But what I have instead is the chance to make the choice to love someone , and the hope that he will choose to love me back , and it is terri@@ fying , but that &apos;s the deal with love .
Thank you .
I was raised by les@@ bi@@ ans in the mountains , and I sort of came like a forest gn@@ ome to New York City a while back .
Re@@ ally mess@@ ed with my head , but I &apos;ll get into that later .
I &apos;ll start with when I was eight years old .
I took a wood box , and I bu@@ ried a dollar b@@ ill , a pen and a for@@ k inside this box in Col@@ or@@ a@@ do .
And I thought some strange human@@ o@@ ids or ali@@ ens in 500 years would find this box and learn about the way our species ex@@ changed ideas , maybe how we ate our sp@@ ag@@ h@@ et@@ ti .
I really didn &apos;t know .
Any@@ way , this is kind of funny , because here I am , 30 years later , and I &apos;m still making box@@ es .
Now , at some point I was in Haw@@ ai@@ i -- I like to hi@@ ke and sur@@ f and do all that weird stuff , and I was making a coll@@ age for my ma .
And I took a dic@@ tionary and I ri@@ pped it up , and I made it into a sort of A@@ g@@ nes Martin gri@@ d , and I pou@@ red res@@ in all over it and a be@@ e got stuck .
Now , she &apos;s afraid of bees and she &apos;s all@@ er@@ gi@@ c to them , so I pou@@ red more res@@ in on the can@@ v@@ as , thinking I could hide it or something .
Instead , the opposite happened : It sort of created a magni@@ fication , like a magni@@ fying glass , on the dic@@ tionary text .
So what did I do ? I built more box@@ es .
This time , I started putting electron@@ ics , fro@@ gs , strange bot@@ t@@ les I &apos;d find in the street -- anything I could find -- because I was always finding things my whole life , and trying to make relationships and tell stories between these objects .
So I started drawing around the objects , and I realized : Ho@@ ly mo@@ ly , I can draw in space !
I can make fre@@ e-@@ flo@@ ating lines , like the way you would draw around a dead body at a crime scene .
So I took the objects out , and I created my own tax@@ onom@@ y of invented spec@@ im@@ ens .
First , bot@@ an@@ ical -- which you can kind of get a sense of .
Then I made some weird insects and creatures .
It was really fun ; I was just drawing on the lay@@ ers of res@@ in .
And it was cool , because I was actually starting to have shows and stuff , I was making some money , I could take my gir@@ l@@ friend for dinner , and like , go to S@@ iz@@ z@@ ler .
It was some good sh@@ it , man .
At some point , I got up to the human form , life@@ -@@ size res@@ in sculp@@ tures with dra@@ wings of humans inside the lay@@ ers .
This was great , except for one thing : I was going to die .
I didn &apos;t know what to do , because the res@@ in was going to kill me .
And I went to bed every night thinking about it .
So I tried using glass .
I started drawing on the lay@@ ers of glass , almost like if you drew on a window , then you put another window , and another window , and you had all these windo@@ ws together that made a three-@@ dimensional com@@ position .
And this really worked , because I could stop using the res@@ in .
So I did this for years , which cul@@ min@@ ated in a very large work , which I call &quot; The T@@ ri@@ p@@ ty@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; The T@@ ri@@ p@@ ty@@ ch &quot; was larg@@ ely inspired by H@@ i@@ er@@ ony@@ m@@ us B@@ os@@ ch &apos;s &quot; &#91; The &#93; Gar@@ den of Ear@@ th@@ ly D@@ eli@@ ghts , &quot; which is a painting in the &#91; Mus@@ e@@ o del &#93; P@@ ra@@ do in S@@ pain .
Do you guys know this painting ?
Good , it &apos;s a cool painting .
It &apos;s kind of ahead of its time , they say .
So , &quot; The T@@ ri@@ p@@ ty@@ ch . &quot; I &apos;ll walk you through this piece .
It we@@ igh@@ s 2@@ 4@@ ,000 pounds .
It &apos;s 18 feet long .
It &apos;s doub@@ le-@@ si@@ ded , so it &apos;s 3@@ 6 feet of com@@ position .
It &apos;s kind of weird .
Well , that &apos;s the blood f@@ ount@@ ain .
To the left , you have J@@ es@@ us and the loc@@ us@@ ts .
There &apos;s a cave where all these anim@@ al-@@ hea@@ ded creatures travel between two worlds .
They go from the repres@@ ent@@ ational world , to this analo@@ g@@ -@@ mes@@ h under@@ world , where they &apos;re hi@@ ding .
This is where the anim@@ al-@@ hea@@ ded creatures are by the li@@ gh@@ thou@@ se , and they &apos;re all about to comm@@ it mass suicide into the ocean .
The ocean is made up of thousands of elements .
This is a bird go@@ d ti@@ ed up to a batt@@ les@@ hi@@ p .
B@@ il@@ ly G@@ ra@@ h@@ am is in the ocean ; the H@@ or@@ iz@@ on from the oil sp@@ ill ; Wal@@ do ; O@@ s@@ ama B@@ in Lad@@ en &apos;s shel@@ ter -- there &apos;s all kinds of weird stuff that you can find if you look really hard , in the ocean .
Any@@ way , this is a lady cre@@ ature .
She &apos;s coming out of the ocean , and she &apos;s sp@@ itting oil into one hand and she has clou@@ ds coming out of her other hand .
Her hands are like sc@@ ales , and she has the my@@ tho@@ logical re@@ ference of the Earth and cosmo@@ s in balance .
So that &apos;s one side of &quot; The T@@ ri@@ p@@ ty@@ ch . &quot;
It &apos;s a little narrative thing .
That &apos;s her hand that she &apos;s sp@@ itting into .
And then , when you go to the other side , she has like a tr@@ un@@ k , like a bird &apos;s b@@ ea@@ k , and she &apos;s sp@@ itting clou@@ ds out of her tr@@ un@@ k .
Then she has an 18@@ -@@ foot@@ -@@ long ser@@ p@@ ent &apos;s tail that connec@@ ts &quot; The T@@ ri@@ p@@ ty@@ ch . &quot;
Any@@ way , her tail cat@@ ches on fire from the back of the vol@@ can@@ o .
I don &apos;t know why that happened .
That happens , you know .
Her tail termin@@ ates in a cy@@ clo@@ p@@ tic ey@@ eball , made out of 198@@ 6 terror@@ ist cards .
Have you guys seen those ?
They were made in the 1980 &apos;s , they &apos;re like baseball cards of terror@@ ists .
W@@ ay ahead of their time .
That will bring you to my lat@@ est project .
I &apos;m in the middle of two projects : One &apos;s called &quot; P@@ sy@@ cho@@ ge@@ ograp@@ hi@@ es . &quot;
It &apos;s about a six@@ -@@ year project to make 100 of these humans .
Each one is an archi@@ ve of our culture , through our ri@@ p@@ pe@@ d-@@ up media and matter , whether it &apos;s enc@@ y@@ clo@@ pe@@ di@@ as or dic@@ tion@@ aries or magaz@@ ines .
But each one acts as a sort of an archi@@ ve in the shape of a human , and they travel in groups of 20 , 4 , or 12 at a time .
They &apos;re like cells -- they come together , they di@@ vide .
And you kind of walk through them . It &apos;s taking me years .
Each one is basically a 3@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ pou@@ nd microscope slide with a human stuck inside .
This one has a little cave in his ch@@ est .
That &apos;s his head ; there &apos;s the ch@@ est , you can kind of see the beginning .
I &apos;m going to go down the body for you : There &apos;s a wat@@ er@@ fall coming out of his ch@@ est , co@@ vering his pen@@ is -- or not@@ -@@ pen@@ is , or whatever it is , a kind of and@@ ro@@ gy@@ n@@ ous thing .
I &apos;ll take you quickly through these works , because I can &apos;t explain them for too long .
There are the lay@@ ers , you can kind of see it .
That &apos;s a body getting sp@@ lit in half .
This one has two heads , and it &apos;s communic@@ ating between the two heads .
You can see the p@@ ills coming out , going into one head from this weird stat@@ ue .
There &apos;s a little forest scene inside the ch@@ est c@@ av@@ ity .
Can you see that ?
Any@@ way , this talk &apos;s all about these box@@ es , like the box@@ es we &apos;re in .
This box we &apos;re in , the solar system is a box .
This brings you to my lat@@ est box .
It &apos;s a bri@@ ck box . It &apos;s called Pi@@ on@@ e@@ er Wor@@ ks .
In@@ side of this box is a physi@@ c@@ ist , a neuro@@ scientist , a pain@@ ter , a musici@@ an , a writer , a radio station , a museum , a school , a publ@@ ishing arm to dis@@ sem@@ in@@ ate all the content we make there into the world ; a gar@@ den .
We sh@@ ake this box up , and all these people kind of start h@@ itting each other like particles .
And I think that &apos;s the way you change the world .
You re@@ define your insi@@ des and the box that you &apos;re living in .
And you come together to realize that we &apos;re all in this together , that this del@@ u@@ sion of difference -- this idea of countries , of bor@@ ders , of religion -- doesn &apos;t work .
We &apos;re all really made up of the same stuff , in the same box .
And if we don &apos;t start ex@@ changing that stuff swe@@ et@@ ly and nic@@ ely , we &apos;re all going to die real soon .
Thank you very much .
What do you do when you have a head@@ ache ?
You s@@ wal@@ low an aspir@@ in .
But for this p@@ ill to get to your head , where the pain is , it goes through your stom@@ ach , int@@ est@@ ines and various other org@@ ans first .
S@@ wal@@ lowing p@@ ills is the most effective and pain@@ less way of deli@@ vering any medic@@ ation in the body .
The down@@ side , though , is that s@@ wal@@ lowing any medic@@ ation leads to its dil@@ ution .
And this is a big problem , particularly in HIV patients .
When they take their anti-@@ HIV drugs , these drugs are good for lo@@ wer@@ ing the virus in the blood , and increasing the C@@ D@@ 4 cell coun@@ ts .
But they are also not@@ ori@@ ous for their ad@@ verse side effects , but mostly bad , because they get dil@@ u@@ ted by the time they get to the blood , and worse , by the time they get to the sites where it matters most : within the HIV vir@@ al res@@ er@@ vo@@ irs .
These areas in the body -- such as the ly@@ mp@@ h no@@ des , the nervous system , as well as the lun@@ gs -- where the virus is sle@@ e@@ ping , and will not read@@ ily get deli@@ vered in the blood of patients that are under consist@@ ent anti-@@ HIV drugs therapy .
However , upon dis@@ continu@@ ation of therapy , the virus can aw@@ ake and inf@@ ect new cells in the blood .
Now , all this is a big problem in tre@@ ating HIV with the current drug treatment , which is a life@@ -@@ long treatment that must be s@@ wal@@ lowed by patients .
One day , I sat and thought , &quot; Can we deliver anti-@@ HIV directly within its res@@ er@@ voir sites , without the risk of drug dil@@ ution ? &quot;
As a laser scientist , the answer was just before my eyes : L@@ as@@ ers , of course .
If they can be used for denti@@ str@@ y , for di@@ abe@@ tic w@@ oun@@ d-@@ heal@@ ing and surgery , they can be used for anything imagin@@ able , including transport@@ ing drugs into cells .
As a matter of fact , we are currently using laser pul@@ ses to po@@ ke or dr@@ ill extremely tiny holes , which open and close almost immediately in HI@@ V@@ -@@ inf@@ ected cells , in order to deliver drugs within them .
&quot; How is that possible ? &quot; you may ask .
Well , we sh@@ ine a very powerful but super-@@ tiny laser b@@ ea@@ m onto the mem@@ br@@ ane of HI@@ V@@ -@@ inf@@ ected cells while these cells are immer@@ sed in liqui@@ d cont@@ aining the drug .
The laser pi@@ er@@ ces the cell , while the cell s@@ wal@@ lows the drug in a matter of micro@@ seconds .
Be@@ fore you even know it , the in@@ duced hole becomes immediately re@@ pai@@ red .
Now , we are currently testing this technology in test tu@@ bes or in Pe@@ tr@@ i dis@@ h@@ es , but the goal is to get this technology in the human body , apply it in the human body .
&quot; How is that possible ? &quot; you may ask .
Well , the answer is : through a three-@@ hea@@ ded device .
U@@ sing the first head , which is our laser , we will make an inc@@ ision in the site of infection .
U@@ sing the second head , which is a camera , we me@@ ander to the site of infection .
Fin@@ ally , using a third head , which is a dru@@ g@@ -@@ sp@@ reading s@@ prin@@ k@@ ler , we deliver the drugs directly at the site of infection , while the laser is again used to po@@ ke those cells open .
Well , this might not seem like much right now .
But one day , if successful , this technology can lead to complete er@@ a@@ dic@@ ation of HIV in the body .
Yes . A cure for HIV .
This is every HIV resear@@ cher &apos;s dream -- in our case , a cure lead by las@@ ers .
Thank you .
For the past decade , I &apos;ve been studying non-@@ state arm@@ ed groups : arm@@ ed organizations like terror@@ ists , in@@ surg@@ ents or mi@@ li@@ ti@@ as .
I document what these groups do when they &apos;re not sho@@ oting .
My goal is to better understand these violent act@@ ors and to study ways to encourage transition from violent engagement to non@@ violent confron@@ tation .
I work in the field , in the policy world and in the libr@@ ary .
Un@@ der@@ standing non-@@ state arm@@ ed groups is key to solving most on@@ going conflict , because war has changed .
It used to be a cont@@ est between states .
No longer .
It is now a conflict between states and non-@@ state act@@ ors .
For example , of the 2@@ 16 peace agre@@ ements signed between 197@@ 5 and 2011 , 19@@ 6 of them were between a state and a non-@@ state actor .
So we need to understand these groups ; we need to either engage them or de@@ fe@@ at them in any conflict resol@@ ution process that has to be successful .
So how do we do that ?
We need to know what makes these organizations tic@@ k .
We know a lot about how they fight , why they fight , but no one looks at what they &apos;re doing when they &apos;re not fighting .
Yet , arm@@ ed struggle and un@@ arm@@ ed politics are related .
It is all part of the same organization .
We cannot understand these groups , let alone de@@ fe@@ at them , if we don &apos;t have the full picture .
And arm@@ ed groups today are complex organizations .
Take the Le@@ ban@@ ese He@@ z@@ b@@ oll@@ ah , known for its violent confron@@ tation against Israel .
But since its creation in the early 198@@ 0s , He@@ z@@ b@@ oll@@ ah has also set up a political party , a soci@@ al-@@ service network , and a military appar@@ at@@ us .
Sim@@ il@@ arly , the Palest@@ in@@ ian H@@ am@@ as , known for its suicide attacks against Israel , also r@@ uns the G@@ az@@ a S@@ trip since 2007 .
So these groups do way more than just sho@@ ot .
They multi-@@ task .
They set up complex communication machines -- radio stations , TV ch@@ ann@@ els , Internet web@@ sites and social media strate@@ gies .
And up here , you have the IS@@ I@@ S magazine , prin@@ ted in English and published to recru@@ it .
Ar@@ med groups also invest in complex fun@@ d-@@ rais@@ ing -- not lo@@ oting , but setting up prof@@ itable businesses ; for example , construction companies .
Now , these acti@@ vi@@ ties are keys .
They allow these groups to increase their strength , increase their fun@@ ds , to better recru@@ it and to build their brand .
Ar@@ med groups also do something else : they build strong@@ er bon@@ ds with the population by inv@@ esting in social services .
They build schools , they run hospitals , they set up voc@@ ation@@ al-@@ training programs or micro-@@ lo@@ an programs .
He@@ z@@ b@@ oll@@ ah off@@ ers all of these services and more .
Ar@@ med groups also see@@ k to win the population over by off@@ ering something that the state is not provi@@ ding : safety and security .
The initi@@ al rise of the T@@ ali@@ ban in war@@ -@@ tor@@ n Afghanistan , or even the beginning of the as@@ cent of IS@@ I@@ S , can be understood also by looking at these groups &apos; efforts to provide security .
Now , unfortunately , in these cases , the pro@@ vision of security came at an un@@ be@@ ar@@ ably high price for the population .
But in general , provi@@ ding social services f@@ ills a gap , a govern@@ ance gap left by the government , and allows these groups to increase their strength and their power .
For example , the 2006 el@@ ect@@ oral vic@@ t@@ ory of the Palest@@ in@@ ian H@@ am@@ as cannot be understood without ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ging the group &apos;s social work .
Now , this is a really complex picture , yet in the West , when we look at arm@@ ed groups , we only think of the violent side .
But that &apos;s not enough to understand these groups &apos; strength , strategy or long-term vision .
These groups are hy@@ bri@@ d .
They rise because they fill a gap left by the government , and they emer@@ ge to be both arm@@ ed and political , engage in violent struggle and provide govern@@ ance .
And the more these organizations are complex and sophistic@@ ated , the less we can think of them as the opposite of a state .
Now , what do you call a group like He@@ z@@ b@@ oll@@ ah ?
They run part of a territ@@ ory , they ad@@ min@@ ister all their func@@ tions , they pick up the gar@@ bage , they run the se@@ w@@ age system .
Is this a state ? Is it a re@@ bel group ?
Or maybe something else , something different and new ?
And what about IS@@ I@@ S ?
The lines are blu@@ r@@ red .
We live in a world of states , non-@@ states , and in-@@ between , and the more states are wea@@ k , like in the Middle East today , the more non-@@ state act@@ ors step in and fill that gap .
This matters for governments , because to coun@@ ter these groups , they will have to invest more in non-@@ military tools .
F@@ illing that govern@@ ance gap has to be at the center of any sustainable approach .
This also matters very much for pe@@ ac@@ em@@ aking and pe@@ ace@@ building .
If we better understand arm@@ ed groups , we will better know what incenti@@ ves to offer to encourage the transition from violence to non@@ violence .
So in this new cont@@ est between states and non-@@ states , military power can win some batt@@ les , but it will not give us peace nor st@@ ability .
To achieve these objec@@ tives , what we need is a long-term investment in f@@ illing that security gap , in f@@ illing that govern@@ ance gap that allowed these groups to th@@ ri@@ ve in the first place .
Thank you .
I am fai@@ ling as a woman , I am fai@@ ling as a fem@@ in@@ ist .
I have passionate opin@@ ions about gender equality , but I worry that to fre@@ ely accept the lab@@ el of &quot; fem@@ in@@ ist , &quot; would not be fair to good fem@@ in@@ ists .
I &apos;m a fem@@ in@@ ist , but I &apos;m a rather bad one .
Oh , so I call myself a B@@ ad F@@ em@@ in@@ ist .
Or at least , I wrote an ess@@ ay , and then I wrote a book called &quot; B@@ ad F@@ em@@ in@@ ist , &quot; and then in intervie@@ ws , people started calling me The B@@ ad F@@ em@@ in@@ ist .
So , what started as a bit of an inside jo@@ ke with myself and a w@@ ill@@ ful pro@@ voc@@ ation , has become a thing .
Let me take a step back .
When I was youn@@ ger , mostly in my te@@ ens and 20@@ s , I had strange ideas about fem@@ in@@ ists as h@@ ai@@ ry , an@@ gry , man@@ -@@ h@@ ating , sex@@ -@@ h@@ ating women -- as if those are bad things .
These days , I look at how women are treated the world over , and anger , in particular , seems like a perfectly reas@@ on@@ able response .
But back then , I worried about the t@@ one people used when sugges@@ ting I might be a fem@@ in@@ ist .
The fem@@ in@@ ist lab@@ el was an acc@@ us@@ ation , it was an &quot; F &quot; word , and not a nice one .
I was lab@@ eled a woman who doesn &apos;t play by the rules , who exp@@ ects too much , by dar@@ ing to believe I &apos;m equal -- -- super@@ ior to a man .
You don &apos;t want to be that re@@ bel woman , until you realize that you very much are that woman , and cannot imagine being anyone else .
As I got older , I began to accept that I am , indeed , a fem@@ in@@ ist , and a proud one .
I hold certain tru@@ ths to be self-@@ evid@@ ent : Women are equal to men .
We des@@ erve equal pay for equal work .
We have the right to move through the world as we choose , free from har@@ ass@@ ment or violence .
We have the right to easy , aff@@ ord@@ able access to birth control , and re@@ productive services .
We have the right to make choices about our bodies , free from leg@@ is@@ l@@ ative over@@ sight or ev@@ ang@@ el@@ ical doc@@ tr@@ ine .
We have the right to respect .
There &apos;s more .
When we talk about the needs of women , we have to consider the other identi@@ ties we in@@ hab@@ it .
We are not just women .
We are people with different bodies , gender expres@@ sions , fai@@ ths , sexu@@ alities , class back@@ gr@@ ounds , abilities , and so much more .
We need to take into account these differences and how they affect us , as much as we account for what we have in common .
Wi@@ th@@ out this kind of inclu@@ sion , our fem@@ in@@ ism is nothing .
I hold these tru@@ ths to be self-@@ evid@@ ent , but let me be clear : I &apos;m a m@@ ess .
I am full of contra@@ dictions .
There are many ways in which I &apos;m doing fem@@ in@@ ism wrong .
I have another conf@@ ession .
When I drive to work , I listen to thu@@ gg@@ ish ra@@ p at a very l@@ oud volume .
Even though the ly@@ ri@@ cs are de@@ grad@@ ing to women -- these ly@@ ri@@ cs off@@ end me to my core -- the classi@@ c Y@@ in Y@@ ang Tw@@ ins song &quot; Sal@@ t Sh@@ ak@@ er &quot; -- it is amazing .
&quot; M@@ ake it work with your w@@ et t-@@ shir@@ t .
B@@ it@@ ch , you got@@ ta sh@@ ake it &apos; til your cam@@ el starts to hur@@ t ! &quot;
Think about it .
Po@@ etry , right ?
I am ut@@ ter@@ ly mor@@ ti@@ fied by my music choices .
I fir@@ m@@ ly believe in man work , which is anything I don &apos;t want to do , including -- -- all domes@@ tic tas@@ ks , but also : bu@@ g killing , tr@@ ash re@@ mo@@ v@@ al , la@@ wn care and vehicle main@@ ten@@ ance .
I want no part of any of that .
P@@ ink is my favorite color .
I enjoy fashion magaz@@ ines and pretty things .
I watch &quot; The B@@ ach@@ el@@ or &quot; and roman@@ tic com@@ e@@ dies , and I have ab@@ sur@@ d fantas@@ ies about fai@@ ry tal@@ es coming true .
Some of my trans@@ gr@@ essions are more fl@@ ag@@ rant .
If a woman wants to take her husband &apos;s name , that is her choice , and it is not my place to ju@@ dge .
If a woman cho@@ o@@ ses to stay home to raise her children , I embr@@ ace that choice , too .
The problem is not that she makes her@@ self econom@@ ically vulnerable in that choice ; the problem is that our society is set up to make women econom@@ ically vulnerable when they choose .
Let &apos;s deal with that .
I rej@@ ect the main@@ stream fem@@ in@@ ism that has histor@@ ically igno@@ red or de@@ fl@@ ected the needs of women of color , work@@ ing-@@ class women , que@@ er women and trans@@ gender women , in fav@@ or of sup@@ porting white , midd@@ le@@ - and up@@ per@@ -@@ class straight women .
L@@ isten , if that &apos;s good fem@@ in@@ ism -- I am a very bad fem@@ in@@ ist .
There is also this : As a fem@@ in@@ ist , I feel a lot of pressure .
We have this tend@@ ency to put visible fem@@ in@@ ists on a pe@@ des@@ tal .
We expect them to pose perfectly .
When they dis@@ ap@@ point us , we g@@ le@@ efully kno@@ ck them from the very pe@@ des@@ tal we put them on .
Like I said , I am a m@@ ess -- consider me kno@@ c@@ ked off that pe@@ des@@ tal before you ever try to put me up there .
To@@ o many women , particularly gr@@ ound@@ breaking women and industry leaders , are afraid to be lab@@ eled as fem@@ in@@ ists .
They &apos;re afraid to stand up and say , &quot; Yes , I am a fem@@ in@@ ist , &quot; for fear of what that lab@@ el means , for fear of being un@@ able to live up to un@@ re@@ alis@@ tic expect@@ ations .
Take , for example , B@@ ey@@ on@@ c@@ é , or as I call her , The Go@@ dd@@ ess .
She has emerg@@ ed , in recent years , as a visible fem@@ in@@ ist .
At the 20@@ 14 M@@ TV V@@ ide@@ o Mu@@ si@@ c A@@ wards , she perform@@ ed in front of the word &quot; fem@@ in@@ ist &quot; 10 feet high .
It was a gl@@ ori@@ ous spectacle to see this pop star open@@ ly embr@@ ac@@ ing fem@@ in@@ ism and l@@ etting young women and men know that being a fem@@ in@@ ist is something to celebr@@ ate .
As the moment f@@ aded , cultural cri@@ tics began end@@ less@@ ly deb@@ ating whether or not B@@ ey@@ on@@ c@@ é was , indeed , a fem@@ in@@ ist .
They grad@@ ed her fem@@ in@@ ism , instead of simply taking a grown , accompl@@ ished woman at her word .
We demand perf@@ ection from fem@@ in@@ ists , because we are still fighting for so much , we want so much , we need so dam@@ n much .
We go far beyond reas@@ on@@ able , construc@@ tive cri@@ tic@@ ism , to dis@@ sec@@ ting any given woman &apos;s fem@@ in@@ ism , t@@ earing it apart until there &apos;s nothing left .
We do not need to do that .
B@@ ad fem@@ in@@ ism -- or really , more inclu@@ sive fem@@ in@@ ism -- is a starting point .
But what happens next ?
We go from ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ging our im@@ perf@@ ections to accoun@@ t@@ ability , or walking the walk , and being a little bit br@@ ave .
If I listen to de@@ grad@@ ing music , I am creating a demand for which artists are more than happy to contribu@@ te a limit@@ less supply .
These artists are not going to change how they talk about women in their son@@ gs until we demand that change by aff@@ ecting their bottom line .
Cert@@ ain@@ ly , it is difficult .
Why must it be so cat@@ ch@@ y ?
It &apos;s hard to make the better choice , and it is so easy to justi@@ fy a less@@ er one .
But -- when I justi@@ fy bad choices , I make it harder for women to achieve equality , the equality that we all des@@ erve , and I need to own that .
I think of my ni@@ eces , ages three and four .
They are gor@@ ge@@ ous and head@@ strong , brilliant girls , who are a whole lot of br@@ ave .
I want them to th@@ ri@@ ve in a world where they are valu@@ ed for the powerful creatures they are .
I think of them , and suddenly , the better choice becomes far easier to make .
We can all make better choices .
We can change the chan@@ nel when a television show tre@@ ats sexual violence against women like sport , G@@ ame of Th@@ r@@ ones .
We can change the radio station when we hear son@@ gs that treat women as nothing .
We can spend our box office dollars el@@ se@@ where when movies don &apos;t treat women as anything more than dec@@ or@@ ative objects .
We can stop sup@@ porting professional sports where the ath@@ let@@ es treat their part@@ ners like pun@@ ching b@@ ags .
In other ways , men -- and especially straight white men -- can say , &quot; No , I will not publ@@ ish with your magazine , or particip@@ ate in your project , or otherwise work with you , until you include a fair number of women , both as participants and decision ma@@ kers .
I won &apos;t work with you until your public@@ ation , or your organization , is more inclu@@ sive of all kinds of difference . &quot;
Those of us who are under@@ repres@@ ented and invited to particip@@ ate in such projects , can also dec@@ line to be inclu@@ ded until more of us are invited through the glass ce@@ iling , and we are to@@ k@@ ens no more .
Wi@@ th@@ out these efforts , without taking these st@@ ands , our accompl@@ ish@@ ments are going to mean very little .
We can comm@@ it these small acts of br@@ av@@ ery and hope that our choices tric@@ k@@ le up@@ ward to the people in power -- ed@@ it@@ ors , movie and music produc@@ ers , CE@@ O@@ s , law@@ ma@@ kers -- the people who can make bigger , br@@ av@@ er choices to create las@@ ting , meaning@@ ful change .
We can also b@@ ol@@ dly claim our fem@@ in@@ ism -- good , bad , or anywhere in between .
The last line of my book &quot; B@@ ad F@@ em@@ in@@ ist &quot; says , &quot; I would rather be a bad fem@@ in@@ ist than no fem@@ in@@ ist at all . &quot;
This is true for so many reasons , but first and fore@@ most , I say this because once upon a time , my voice was st@@ ol@@ en from me , and fem@@ in@@ ism helped me to get my voice back .
There was an in@@ cident .
I call it an in@@ cident so I can carry the bur@@ den of what happened .
Some boys broke me , when I was so young , I did not know what boys can do to break a girl .
They treated me like I was nothing .
I began to believe I was nothing .
They st@@ ole my voice , and in the after , I did not d@@ are to believe that anything I might say could matter .
But -- I had writing .
And there , I wrote myself back together .
I wrote myself toward a strong@@ er version of myself .
I read the words of women who might understand a story like mine , and women who looked like me , and understood what it was like to move through the world with bro@@ wn skin .
I read the words of women who showed me I was not nothing .
I learned to write like them , and then I learned to write as myself .
I found my voice again , and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond measure .
Th@@ r@@ ough writing and fem@@ in@@ ism , I also found that if I was a little bit br@@ ave , another woman might hear me and see me and recognize that none of us are the nothing the world tries to tell us we are .
In one hand , I hold the power to accompl@@ ish anything .
And in my other , I hold the hum@@ bling reality that I am just one woman .
I am a bad fem@@ in@@ ist , I am a good woman , I am trying to become better in how I think , and what I say , and what I do , without aband@@ oning everything that makes me human .
I hope that we can all do the same .
I hope that we can all be a little bit br@@ ave , when we most need such br@@ av@@ ery .
Just after Christ@@ mas last year , 1@@ 32 kids in California got the me@@ as@@ les by either vis@@ iting Dis@@ ne@@ y@@ land or being ex@@ posed to someone who &apos;d been there .
The virus then hop@@ ped the Can@@ adi@@ an bor@@ der , inf@@ ecting more than 100 children in Qu@@ e@@ be@@ c .
One of the trag@@ ic things about this out@@ break is that me@@ as@@ les , which can be fat@@ al to a child with a wea@@ k@@ en@@ ed imm@@ une system , is one of the most easily prev@@ ent@@ able diseases in the world .
An effective vacc@@ ine against it has been available for more than half a century , but many of the kids involved in the Dis@@ ne@@ y@@ land out@@ break had not been vacc@@ in@@ ated because their parents were afraid of something alle@@ ge@@ dly even worse : autism .
But wait -- wasn &apos;t the paper that s@@ par@@ ked the contro@@ vers@@ y about autism and vacc@@ ines deb@@ un@@ ked , re@@ trac@@ ted , and br@@ and@@ ed a deli@@ ber@@ ate fr@@ au@@ d by the British Medic@@ al J@@ our@@ n@@ al ?
Don &apos;t most sci@@ ence@@ -@@ sav@@ v@@ y people know that the theory that vacc@@ ines cause autism is B@@ .@@ S. ?
I think most of you do , but millions of parents worldwide continue to fear that vacc@@ ines put their kids at risk for autism .
Why ?
Here &apos;s why .
This is a graph of autism pre@@ val@@ ence esti@@ mates ris@@ ing over time .
For most of the 20th century , autism was considered an incredibly rare condition .
The few psycho@@ logists and pe@@ di@@ atr@@ ici@@ ans who &apos;d even heard of it figured they would get through their entire care@@ ers without seeing a single case .
For decades , the pre@@ val@@ ence esti@@ mates re@@ main@@ ed stable at just three or four children in 10,000 .
But then , in the 199@@ 0s , the numbers started to sk@@ y@@ ro@@ cket .
F@@ un@@ d@@ rais@@ ing organizations like Au@@ tis@@ m S@@ pea@@ ks rout@@ in@@ ely re@@ fer to autism as an epidemic , as if you could catch it from another kid at Dis@@ ne@@ y@@ land .
So what &apos;s going on ?
If it isn &apos;t vacc@@ ines , what is it ?
If you ask the folks down at the C@@ ent@@ ers for Dis@@ ease Con@@ tro@@ l in At@@ l@@ anta what &apos;s going on , they tend to rely on ph@@ r@@ ases like &quot; broad@@ en@@ ed diagnostic cr@@ it@@ eria &quot; and &quot; better case finding &quot; to explain these ris@@ ing numbers .
But that kind of language doesn &apos;t do much to all@@ ay the f@@ ears of a young mother who is se@@ arch@@ ing her two-@@ year-old &apos;s face for eye contact .
If the diagnostic cr@@ it@@ eria had to be broad@@ en@@ ed , why were they so nar@@ row in the first place ?
Why were cases of autism so hard to find before the 199@@ 0s ?
F@@ ive years ago , I decided to try to un@@ cover the answers to these questions .
I learned that what happened has less to do with the slow and cau@@ tious progress of science than it does with the se@@ duc@@ tive power of stor@@ y@@ telling .
For most of the 20th century , clin@@ ici@@ ans told one story about what autism is and how it was discovered , but that story turned out to be wrong , and the consequences of it are having a dev@@ as@@ tat@@ ing impact on global public health .
There was a second , more accur@@ ate story of autism which had been lost and for@@ gotten in obs@@ cure cor@@ ners of the clinical liter@@ ature .
This second story tells us everything about how we got here and where we need to go next .
The first story starts with a child psychi@@ atr@@ ist at Joh@@ ns H@@ op@@ kins Ho@@ sp@@ ital named Le@@ o K@@ ann@@ er .
In 194@@ 3 , K@@ ann@@ er published a paper descri@@ bing 11 young patients who seemed to in@@ hab@@ it private worlds , ignor@@ ing the people around them , even their own parents .
They could am@@ use themselves for hours by fl@@ apping their hands in front of their faces , but they were pan@@ ic@@ ked by little things like their favorite to@@ y being moved from its usual place without their knowledge .
B@@ ased on the patients who were brought to his clin@@ ic , K@@ ann@@ er spec@@ ul@@ ated that autism is very rare .
By the 195@@ 0s , as the world &apos;s leading auth@@ ority on the subject , he dec@@ lar@@ ed that he had seen less than 150 true cases of his syn@@ drome while fiel@@ ding refer@@ r@@ als from as far away as South Africa .
That &apos;s actually not surprising , because K@@ ann@@ er &apos;s cr@@ it@@ eria for diagno@@ sing autism were incredibly sel@@ ective .
For example , he dis@@ cour@@ aged giving the diagno@@ sis to children who had se@@ iz@@ u@@ res but now we know that e@@ pil@@ ep@@ s@@ y is very common in autism .
He once br@@ ag@@ ged that he had turned nine out of 10 kids refer@@ red to his office as au@@ ti@@ stic by other clin@@ ici@@ ans without giving them an autism diagno@@ sis .
K@@ ann@@ er was a smart guy , but a number of his the@@ ories didn &apos;t p@@ an out .
He classi@@ fied autism as a form of inf@@ anti@@ le psycho@@ sis caused by cold and un@@ affec@@ tion@@ ate parents .
These children , he said , had been kept ne@@ at@@ ly in a re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ator that didn &apos;t de@@ fro@@ st .
At the same time , how@@ ever , K@@ ann@@ er noticed that some of his young patients had special abilities that clu@@ st@@ ered in certain areas like music , math and memory .
One boy in his clin@@ ic could distin@@ gu@@ ish between 18 sym@@ phon@@ ies before he turned two .
When his mother put on one of his favorite records , he would correc@@ tly dec@@ l@@ are , &quot; Be@@ eth@@ o@@ ven ! &quot;
But K@@ ann@@ er took a di@@ m view of these abilities , cl@@ aim@@ ing that the kids were just re@@ gu@@ r@@ g@@ it@@ ating things they &apos;d heard their po@@ m@@ pou@@ s parents say , des@@ per@@ ate to ear@@ n their appro@@ v@@ al .
As a result , autism became a source of sh@@ ame and sti@@ g@@ ma for families , and two generations of au@@ ti@@ stic children were shi@@ pped off to institutions for their own good , becoming invisible to the world at large .
Amaz@@ ingly , it wasn &apos;t until the 197@@ 0s that researchers began to test K@@ ann@@ er &apos;s theory that autism was rare .
L@@ or@@ na W@@ ing was a cognitive psycho@@ logist in London who thought that K@@ ann@@ er &apos;s theory of re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ator par@@ enting were &quot; bloo@@ dy stupid , &quot; as she told me .
She and her husband John were warm and affec@@ tion@@ ate people , and they had a prof@@ ound@@ ly au@@ ti@@ stic daughter named Su@@ sie .
L@@ or@@ na and John knew how hard it was to raise a child like Su@@ sie without support services , special education , and the other resources that are out of reach without a diagno@@ sis .
To make the case to the National Health Ser@@ vice that more resources were needed for au@@ ti@@ stic children and their families , L@@ or@@ na and her colle@@ ague Ju@@ d@@ ith G@@ ould decided to do something that should have been done 30 years earlier .
They under@@ took a study of autism pre@@ val@@ ence in the general population .
They pou@@ n@@ ded the p@@ av@@ ement in a London su@@ bur@@ b called Cam@@ ber@@ well to try to find au@@ ti@@ stic children in the community .
What they saw made clear that K@@ ann@@ er &apos;s model was way too nar@@ row , while the reality of autism was much more color@@ ful and di@@ verse .
Some kids couldn &apos;t talk at all , while others w@@ ax@@ ed on at l@@ ength about their fascin@@ ation with astr@@ oph@@ ysi@@ cs , dinosau@@ rs or the gene@@ alo@@ g@@ y of roy@@ al@@ ty .
In other words , these children didn &apos;t fit into nice , ne@@ at box@@ es , as Ju@@ d@@ ith put it , and they saw lots of them , way more than K@@ ann@@ er &apos;s mon@@ oli@@ th@@ ic model would have predic@@ ted .
At first , they were at a loss to make sense of their data .
How had no one noticed these children before ?
But then L@@ or@@ na came upon a re@@ ference to a paper that had been published in Ger@@ man in 194@@ 4 , the year after K@@ ann@@ er &apos;s paper , and then for@@ gotten , bu@@ ried with the ash@@ es of a terrible time that no one wanted to remember or think about .
K@@ ann@@ er knew about this comp@@ eting paper , but s@@ cru@@ pul@@ ously av@@ o@@ ided menti@@ oning it in his own work .
It had never even been transl@@ ated into English , but lu@@ ck@@ ily , L@@ or@@ na &apos;s husband spoke Ger@@ man , and he transl@@ ated it for her .
The paper off@@ ered an altern@@ ate story of autism .
I@@ ts auth@@ or was a man named H@@ ans A@@ sper@@ ger , who ran a combin@@ ation clin@@ ic and res@@ identi@@ al school in Vi@@ enn@@ a in the 19@@ 3@@ 0s .
A@@ sper@@ ger &apos;s ideas about teaching children with learning differences were progr@@ essive even by contempor@@ ary standards .
Mor@@ n@@ ings at his clin@@ ic began with exercise classes set to music , and the children put on plays on S@@ un@@ day after@@ no@@ ons .
Instead of bl@@ aming parents for caus@@ ing autism , A@@ sper@@ ger fr@@ amed it as a li@@ fel@@ ong , poly@@ genetic dis@@ ability that requires compas@@ sionate forms of support and ac@@ com@@ mod@@ ations over the course of one &apos;s whole life .
R@@ a@@ ther than tre@@ ating the kids in his clin@@ ic like patients , A@@ sper@@ ger called them his little profess@@ ors , and en@@ lis@@ ted their help in developing metho@@ ds of education that were particularly su@@ ited to them .
C@@ ru@@ ci@@ ally , A@@ sper@@ ger vie@@ wed autism as a di@@ verse continu@@ um that sp@@ ans an as@@ ton@@ ishing range of gi@@ f@@ te@@ d@@ ness and dis@@ ability .
He believed that autism and au@@ ti@@ stic traits are common and always have been , seeing aspects of this continu@@ um in familiar arch@@ et@@ y@@ pes from pop culture like the soci@@ ally aw@@ k@@ ward scientist and the ab@@ sent@@ -@@ min@@ ded professor .
He went so far as to say , it seems that for success in science and art , a d@@ ash of autism is essential .
L@@ or@@ na and Ju@@ d@@ ith realized that K@@ ann@@ er had been as wrong about autism being rare as he had been about parents caus@@ ing it .
Over the next several years , they qui@@ et@@ ly worked with the American P@@ sy@@ chi@@ atri@@ c As@@ soci@@ ation to broad@@ en the cr@@ it@@ eria for diagno@@ sis to refl@@ ect the diversity of what they called &quot; the autism spectrum . &quot;
In the late &apos; 8@@ 0s and early 199@@ 0s , their changes went into effect , sw@@ apping out K@@ ann@@ er &apos;s nar@@ row model for A@@ sper@@ ger &apos;s bro@@ ad and inclu@@ sive one .
These changes weren &apos;t happening in a vac@@ u@@ um .
By co@@ in@@ cid@@ ence , as L@@ or@@ na and Ju@@ d@@ ith worked behind the scen@@ es to re@@ form the cr@@ it@@ eria , people all over the world were seeing an au@@ ti@@ stic adult for the first time .
Be@@ fore &quot; R@@ ain Man &quot; came out in 198@@ 8 , only a tiny , ing@@ ro@@ wn circle of experts knew what autism looked like , but after D@@ us@@ tin H@@ off@@ man &apos;s un@@ for@@ get@@ table performance as R@@ ay@@ mon@@ d Bab@@ bit@@ t ear@@ ned &quot; R@@ ain Man &quot; four Ac@@ adem@@ y A@@ wards , pe@@ di@@ atr@@ ici@@ ans , psycho@@ logists , teachers and parents all over the world knew what autism looked like .
Co@@ in@@ cident@@ ally , at the same time , the first eas@@ y-@@ to-@@ use clinical tests for diagno@@ sing autism were introduced .
You no longer had to have a connection to that tiny circle of experts to get your child ev@@ alu@@ ated .
The combin@@ ation of &quot; R@@ ain Man , &quot; the changes to the cr@@ it@@ eria , and the intro@@ duction of these tests created a network effect , a perfect stor@@ m of autism awareness .
The number of diagno@@ ses started to so@@ ar , just as L@@ or@@ na and Ju@@ d@@ ith predic@@ ted , indeed hop@@ ed , that it would , en@@ ab@@ ling au@@ ti@@ stic people and their families to finally get the support and services they des@@ er@@ ved .
Then Andrew W@@ a@@ ke@@ field came along to bl@@ ame the spi@@ ke in diagno@@ ses on vacc@@ ines , a simple , powerful , and se@@ duc@@ tively believ@@ able story that was as wrong as K@@ ann@@ er &apos;s theory that autism was rare .
If the C@@ D@@ C &apos;s current estim@@ ate , that one in 6@@ 8 kids in America are on the spectrum , is correct , au@@ tis@@ tics are one of the largest min@@ ority groups in the world .
In recent years , au@@ ti@@ stic people have come together on the Internet to rej@@ ect the notion that they are puzz@@ les to be solved by the next medical break@@ through , co@@ in@@ ing the term &quot; neuro@@ diversity &quot; to celebr@@ ate the vari@@ eties of human cogni@@ tion .
One way to understand neuro@@ diversity is to think in terms of human operating systems .
Just because a P@@ .@@ C. is not running W@@ in@@ do@@ ws doesn &apos;t mean that it &apos;s broken .
By au@@ ti@@ stic standards , the normal human brain is easily distr@@ act@@ able , obs@@ essi@@ vely social , and suff@@ ers from a de@@ fic@@ it of attention to detail .
To be sure , au@@ ti@@ stic people have a hard time living in a world not built for them .
&#91; S@@ ev@@ enty &#93; years later , we &apos;re still cat@@ ching up to A@@ sper@@ ger , who believed that the &quot; cure &quot; for the most dis@@ ab@@ ling aspects of autism is to be found in understanding teachers , ac@@ com@@ mod@@ ating employ@@ ers , sup@@ por@@ tive communities , and parents who have faith in their children &apos;s potential .
An au@@ ti@@ stic &#91; man &#93; named Z@@ o@@ sia Z@@ a@@ ks once said , &quot; We need all hands on dec@@ k to right the ship of humanity . &quot;
As we s@@ ail into an un@@ certain future , we need every form of human intelligence on the planet working together to t@@ ack@@ le the challenges that we face as a society .
We can &apos;t afford to waste a brain .
Thank you .
So , this is a story about how we know what we know .
It &apos;s a story about this woman , N@@ at@@ ali@@ a R@@ y@@ b@@ c@@ z@@ yn@@ sk@@ i .
She &apos;s a pal@@ e@@ o@@ bio@@ logist , which means she speci@@ aliz@@ es in di@@ gg@@ ing up really old dead stuff .
N@@ at@@ ali@@ a R@@ y@@ b@@ c@@ z@@ yn@@ sk@@ i : Yeah , I had someone call me &quot; Dr. D@@ ead Th@@ ings . &quot;
L@@ ati@@ f N@@ ass@@ er : And I think she &apos;s particularly interesting because of where she di@@ gs that stuff up , way above the Ar@@ c@@ tic C@@ ir@@ cle in the remote Can@@ adi@@ an tun@@ dr@@ a .
Now , one summer day in 2006 , she was at a di@@ g site called the F@@ y@@ les Lea@@ f B@@ ed , which is less than 10 degrees l@@ ati@@ tude away from the mag@@ ne@@ tic nor@@ th po@@ le .
N@@ R : Re@@ ally , it &apos;s not going to sound very exciting , because it was a day of walking with your back@@ p@@ ack and your GPS and not@@ e@@ book and just pic@@ king up anything that might be a fossi@@ l .
L@@ N : And at some point , she noticed something .
N@@ R : Ru@@ st@@ y , kind of ru@@ st-@@ colo@@ red , about the size of the pal@@ m of my hand .
It was just lying on the surface .
L@@ N : And at first she thought it was just a s@@ pl@@ in@@ ter of wood , because that &apos;s the sort of thing people had found at the F@@ y@@ les Lea@@ f B@@ ed before -- pre@@ histor@@ ic plant parts .
But that night , back at camp ...
N@@ R : ... I get out the hand l@@ ens , I &apos;m looking a little bit more clo@@ sely and realiz@@ ing it doesn &apos;t quite look like this has tree r@@ ings .
Maybe it &apos;s a pres@@ er@@ vation thing , but it looks really like ...
bone .
L@@ N : Hu@@ h . So over the next four years , she went to that spot over and over , and eventually coll@@ ected 30 frag@@ ments of that exact same bone , most of them really tiny .
N@@ R : It &apos;s not a whole lot . It fits in a small Z@@ i@@ pl@@ o@@ c b@@ ag .
L@@ N : And she tried to piece them together like a j@@ ig@@ saw puzzle .
But it was challeng@@ ing .
N@@ R : It &apos;s broken up into so many little tiny pieces , I &apos;m trying to use sand and put@@ ty , and it &apos;s not looking good .
So finally , we used a 3D surface scanner .
L@@ N : O@@ oh ! N@@ R : Yeah , right ?
L@@ N : It turns out it was way easier to do it vir@@ tually .
N@@ R : It &apos;s kind of mag@@ ical when it all fits together .
L@@ N : How certain were you that you had it right , that you had put it together in the right way ?
W@@ as there a potential that you &apos;d put it together a different way and have , like , a par@@ a@@ ke@@ et or something ?
N@@ R : U@@ m , no . No , we got this .
L@@ N : What she had , she discovered , was a ti@@ bia , a leg bone , and specifically , one that bel@@ ong@@ ed to a clo@@ ven@@ -@@ ho@@ of@@ ed mam@@ mal , so something like a co@@ w or a she@@ ep .
But it couldn &apos;t have been either of those .
It was just too big .
N@@ R : The size of this thing , it was huge . It &apos;s a really big animal .
L@@ N : So what animal could it be ?
H@@ aving hit a wall , she showed one of the frag@@ ments to some colleagues of h@@ ers in Col@@ or@@ a@@ do , and they had an idea .
N@@ R : We took a saw , and we nic@@ ked just the edge of it , and there was this really interesting smell that comes from it .
L@@ N : It sm@@ ell@@ ed kind of like sing@@ ed fl@@ esh .
It was a smell that N@@ at@@ ali@@ a recogni@@ zed from cut@@ ting up sk@@ ul@@ ls in her gro@@ ss an@@ atom@@ y lab : coll@@ ag@@ en .
C@@ oll@@ ag@@ en is what gives structure to our b@@ ones .
And usually , after so many years , it brea@@ ks down .
But in this case , the Ar@@ c@@ tic had acted like a natural free@@ z@@ er and pres@@ er@@ ved it .
Then a year or two later , N@@ at@@ ali@@ a was at a conference in B@@ ris@@ to@@ l , and she saw that a colle@@ ague of h@@ ers named Mi@@ ke Bu@@ ck@@ ley was demo@@ ing this new process that he called &quot; coll@@ ag@@ en fin@@ ger@@ printing . &quot;
It turns out that different species have slightly different structures of coll@@ ag@@ en , so if you get a coll@@ ag@@ en pro@@ file of an un@@ known bone , you can compare it to those of known species , and , who knows , maybe you get a match .
So she shi@@ pped him one of the frag@@ ments , F@@ ed@@ E@@ x .
N@@ R : Yeah , you want to track it . It &apos;s kind of important .
L@@ N : And he proc@@ essed it , and compared it to 3@@ 7 known and moder@@ n@@ -@@ day mam@@ mal species .
And he found a match .
It turns out that the 3@@ .@@ 5 milli@@ on-@@ year-old bone that N@@ at@@ ali@@ a had du@@ g out of the H@@ igh Ar@@ c@@ tic bel@@ ong@@ ed to ...
a cam@@ el .
N@@ R : And I &apos;m thinking , what ? That &apos;s amazing -- if it &apos;s true .
L@@ N : So they tes@@ ted a bunch of the frag@@ ments , and they got the same result for each one .
However , based on the size of the bone that they found , it meant that this cam@@ el was 30 percent larger than moder@@ n@@ -@@ day cam@@ els .
So this cam@@ el would have been about nine feet t@@ all , we@@ igh@@ ed around a ton .
Yeah .
N@@ at@@ ali@@ a had found a Gi@@ ant Ar@@ c@@ tic cam@@ el .
Now , when you hear the word &quot; cam@@ el , &quot; what may come to mind is one of these , the B@@ ac@@ tri@@ an cam@@ el of East and Centr@@ al Asia .
But chances are the pos@@ t@@ card image you have in your brain is one of these , the dr@@ om@@ ed@@ ary , qu@@ int@@ essential desert cre@@ ature -- h@@ ang@@ s out in sand@@ y , hot places like the Middle East and the Sahar@@ a , has a big old hum@@ p on its back for stor@@ ing water for those long desert tre@@ ks , has big , bro@@ ad feet to help it trom@@ p over sand d@@ unes .
So how on earth would one of these guys end up in the H@@ igh Ar@@ c@@ tic ?
Well , scientists have known for a long time , turns out , even before N@@ at@@ ali@@ a &apos;s discovery , that cam@@ els are actually origin@@ ally American .
They started here .
For nearly 40 of the 45 million years that cam@@ els have been around , you could only find them in North America , around 20 different species , maybe more .
L@@ N : If I put them all in a lin@@ eu@@ p , would they look different ?
N@@ R : Yeah , you &apos;re going to have different body si@@ zes .
You &apos;ll have some with really long nec@@ ks , so they &apos;re actually func@@ tion@@ ally like gi@@ ra@@ ff@@ es .
L@@ N : Some had s@@ nou@@ ts , like cro@@ co@@ di@@ les .
N@@ R : The really prim@@ itive , early ones would have been really small , almost like rab@@ bits .
L@@ N : What ? R@@ ab@@ b@@ it-@@ si@@ zed cam@@ els ?
N@@ R : The ear@@ li@@ est ones .
So those ones you probably would not recognize .
L@@ N : Oh my God , I want a p@@ et rab@@ b@@ it-@@ cam@@ el .
N@@ R : I know , wouldn &apos;t that be great ?
L@@ N : And then about three to seven million years ago , one bran@@ ch of cam@@ els went down to South America , where they became l@@ lam@@ as and al@@ p@@ ac@@ as , and another bran@@ ch cross@@ ed over the B@@ ering L@@ and Bri@@ dge into Asia and Africa .
And then around the end of the last ice age , North American cam@@ els went extinc@@ t .
So , scientists knew all of that already , but it still doesn &apos;t fully explain how N@@ at@@ ali@@ a found one so far nor@@ th .
Like , this is , temper@@ atu@@ re-@@ wise , the pol@@ ar opposite of the Sahar@@ a .
Now to be fair , three and a half million years ago , it was on average 22 degrees Cel@@ si@@ us war@@ mer than it is now .
So it would have been bo@@ real forest , so more like the Y@@ u@@ k@@ on or Si@@ ber@@ ia today .
But still , like , they would have six@@ -@@ mon@@ th-@@ long w@@ inter@@ s where the pon@@ ds would free@@ ze over .
You &apos;d have bli@@ zz@@ ards .
You &apos;d have 24 hours a day of straight dark@@ ness .
Like , how ... How ?
How is it that one of these Sahar@@ an super@@ stars could ever have surviv@@ ed those ar@@ c@@ tic conditions ?
N@@ at@@ ali@@ a and her colleagues think they have an answer .
And it &apos;s kind of brilliant .
What if the very fe@@ atures that we imagine make the cam@@ el so well-@@ su@@ ited to places like the Sahar@@ a , actually evolved to help it get through the win@@ ter ?
What if those bro@@ ad feet were meant to trom@@ p not over sand , but over s@@ now , like a pair of s@@ now@@ shoes ?
What if that hum@@ p -- which , huge news to me , does not cont@@ ain water , it cont@@ ains f@@ at -- was there to help the cam@@ el get through that six@@ -@@ mon@@ th-@@ long win@@ ter , when food was scar@@ ce ?
And then , only later , long after it cross@@ ed over the land bridge did it re@@ tro@@ fit those win@@ ter fe@@ atures for a hot desert environment ?
Like , for instance , the hum@@ p may be hel@@ p@@ ful to cam@@ els in hot@@ ter cli@@ mes because having all your f@@ at in one place , like a , you know , f@@ at back@@ p@@ ack , means that you don &apos;t have to have that insul@@ ation all over the rest of your body .
So it helps heat dis@@ si@@ p@@ ate easier .
It &apos;s this crazy idea , that what seems like pro@@ of of the cam@@ el &apos;s qu@@ int@@ essential desert nature could actually be pro@@ of of its H@@ igh Ar@@ c@@ tic past .
Now , I &apos;m not the first person to tell this story .
O@@ thers have told it as a way to mar@@ v@@ el at evolutionary biology or as a ke@@ y@@ hole into the future of climate change .
But I love it for a totally different reason .
For me , it &apos;s a story about us , about how we see the world and about how that changes .
So I was trained as a histori@@ an .
And I &apos;ve learned that , actually , a lot of scientists are histori@@ ans , too .
They make sense of the past .
They tell the history of our universe , of our planet , of life on this planet .
And as a histori@@ an , you start with an idea in your mind of how the story goes .
N@@ R : We make up stories and we stick with it , like the cam@@ el in the desert , right ?
That &apos;s a great story ! It &apos;s totally adap@@ ted for that .
C@@ lear@@ ly , it always lived there .
L@@ N : But at any moment , you could un@@ cover some tiny bit of evidence .
You could learn some tiny thing that forces you to re@@ frame everything you thought you knew .
Like , in this case , this one scientist fin@@ ds this one sh@@ ard of what she thought was wood , and because of that , science has a totally new and totally counter@@ intu@@ itive theory about why this ab@@ sur@@ d Dr. S@@ eu@@ ss@@ -@@ looking cre@@ ature looks the way it does .
And for me , it completely u@@ pend@@ ed the way I think of the cam@@ el .
It went from being this ridi@@ cul@@ ously ni@@ che cre@@ ature su@@ ited only to this one specific environment , to being this world trav@@ el@@ er that just happens to be in the Sahar@@ a , and could end up vir@@ tually anywhere .
This is A@@ z@@ ur@@ i .
A@@ z@@ ur@@ i , hi , how are you doing ?
OK , here , I &apos;ve got one of these for you here .

That &apos;s not even a jo@@ ke .
Any@@ way -- But really , A@@ z@@ ur@@ i is here as a living re@@ min@@ der that the story of our world is a dynamic one .
It requires our w@@ ill@@ ing@@ ness to read@@ just , to re@@ imagine .
Right , A@@ z@@ ur@@ i ?
And , really , that we &apos;re all just one sh@@ ard of bone away from seeing the world an@@ ew .
Thank you very much .
Today &apos;s computers are so amazing that we fail to notice how terrible they really are .
I &apos;d like to talk to you today about this problem , and how we can fix it with neuro@@ science .
First , I &apos;d like to take you back to a fro@@ st@@ y night in Har@@ lem in 2011 that had a profound impact on me .
I was sitting in a di@@ ve bar outside of Col@@ um@@ bia University , where I studied computer science and neuro@@ science , and I was having this great conversation with a fellow student about the power of ho@@ lo@@ gr@@ ams to one day re@@ place computers .
And just as we were getting to the best part of the conversation , of course , his phone lights up .
And he pul@@ ls it towards himself , and he looks down and he starts ty@@ ping .
And then he forces his ey@@ e@@ b@@ alls back up to mine and he goes , &quot; Ke@@ ep going . I &apos;m with you . &quot;
But of course his eyes were g@@ la@@ zed over , and the moment was dead .
Me@@ an@@ while across the bar , I noticed another student holding his phone , this time towards a group .
He was swi@@ ping through pictures on Inst@@ ag@@ ram , and these kids were laugh@@ ing hy@@ ster@@ ically .
And that di@@ ch@@ ot@@ om@@ y between how cr@@ app@@ y I was feeling and how happy they were feeling about the same technology , really got me thinking .
And the more I thought of it , the more I realized it was clearly not the digital information that was the bad guy here , it was simply the dis@@ play position that was separ@@ ating me from my friend and that was bin@@ ding those kids together .
See , they were connected around something , just like our ancest@@ ors who evolved their social cogni@@ tions telling stories around the camp@@ fire .
And that &apos;s exactly what tools should do , I think .
They should ex@@ tend our bodies .
And I think computers today are doing quite the opposite .
Wh@@ e@@ ther you &apos;re sending an email to your wife or you &apos;re compos@@ ing a sym@@ ph@@ ony or just con@@ sol@@ ing a friend , you &apos;re doing it in pretty much the same way .
You &apos;re hun@@ ched over these rec@@ t@@ angles , fu@@ m@@ bling with but@@ tons and men@@ us and more rec@@ t@@ angles .
And I think this is the wrong way , I think we can start using a much more natural machine .
We should use machines that bring our work back into the world .
We should use machines that use the principles of neuro@@ science to ex@@ tend our sen@@ ses versus going against them .
Now it just so happens that I have such a machine here .
It &apos;s called the M@@ et@@ a 2 .
Let &apos;s try it out .
Now in front of me right now , I can see the audience , and I can see my very hands .
And in three , two , one , we &apos;re going to see an immer@@ sive ho@@ lo@@ gram appear , a very re@@ alis@@ tic ho@@ lo@@ gram appear in front of me , of our very gl@@ asses I &apos;m wearing on my head right now .
And of course this could be anything that we &apos;re sh@@ op@@ ping for or learning from , and I can use my hands to very nic@@ ely kind of move it around with fine control .
And I think I@@ r@@ on Man would be proud .
We &apos;re going to come back to this in just a bit .
Now if you &apos;re anything like me , your mind is already re@@ eling with the possibilities of what we can do with this kind of technology , so let &apos;s look at a few .
My mom is an archit@@ ect , so natur@@ ally the first thing I imagin@@ ed was l@@ aying out a building in 3D space instead of having to use these 2@@ D floor plans .
She &apos;s actually tou@@ ching graph@@ ics right now and sel@@ ecting an inter@@ ior dec@@ or .
This was all shot through a Go@@ Pr@@ o through our very gl@@ asses .
And this next use case is very personal to me , it &apos;s Pro@@ f@@ essor Adam G@@ az@@ z@@ al@@ ey &apos;s glass brain project , cour@@ tes@@ y of U@@ C@@ S@@ F .
As a neuro@@ science student , I would always fantas@@ ize about the ability to learn and mem@@ or@@ ize these complex brain structures with an actual machine , where I could touch and play with the various brain structures .
Now what you &apos;re seeing is called augment@@ ed reality , but to me , it &apos;s part of a much more important story -- a story of how we can begin to ex@@ tend our bodies with digital devices , instead of the other way around .
Now ...
in the next few years , humanity &apos;s going to go through a shift , I think .
We &apos;re going to start putting an entire layer of digital information on the real world .
Just imagine for a moment what this could mean for stor@@ y@@ t@@ ell@@ ers , for pain@@ ters , for brain surge@@ ons , for inter@@ ior dec@@ or@@ ators and maybe for all of us here today .
And what I think we need to do as a community , is really try and make an effort to imagine how we can create this new reality in a way that ext@@ ends the human experience , instead of gam@@ i@@ fying our reality or c@@ lut@@ ter@@ ing it with digital information .
And that &apos;s what I &apos;m very passionate about .
Now , I want to tell you a little secret .
In about five years -- this is not the small@@ est device -- in about five years , these are all going to look like stri@@ ps of glass on our eyes that project ho@@ lo@@ gr@@ ams .
And just like we don &apos;t care so much about which phone we buy in terms of the hard@@ ware -- we buy it for the operating system -- as a neuro@@ scientist , I always dre@@ am@@ t of building the i@@ O@@ S of the mind , if you will .
And it &apos;s very , very important that we get this right , because we might be living inside of these things for at least as long as we &apos;ve lived with the W@@ in@@ do@@ ws graph@@ ical user interface .
And I don &apos;t know about you , but living inside of W@@ in@@ do@@ ws scar@@ es me .
To isol@@ ate the single most intu@@ itive interface out of infin@@ ity , we use neuro@@ science to drive our design gu@@ id@@ el@@ ines , instead of l@@ etting a bunch of designers fight it out in the bo@@ ar@@ dro@@ om .
And the principle we all re@@ vol@@ ve around is what &apos;s called the &quot; N@@ eu@@ ral P@@ ath of Le@@ ast Res@@ istance . &quot;
At every turn , we &apos;re connec@@ ting the i@@ O@@ S of the brain with our brain on , for the first time , our brain &apos;s terms .
In other words , we &apos;re trying to create a zero lear@@ n@@ ing-@@ cur@@ ve computer .
We &apos;re building a system that you &apos;ve always known how to use .
Here are the first three design gu@@ id@@ el@@ ines that we empl@@ o@@ y in this br@@ and-@@ new form of user experience .
First and fore@@ most , you are the operating system .
T@@ radi@@ tional file systems are complex and abstr@@ act , and they take your brain extra steps to dec@@ ode them .
We &apos;re going against the N@@ eu@@ ral P@@ ath of Le@@ ast Res@@ istance .
Me@@ an@@ while , in augment@@ ed reality , you can of course place your ho@@ lo@@ graphi@@ c TED pan@@ el over here , and your ho@@ lo@@ graphi@@ c email on the other side of the des@@ k , and your spatial memory evolved just fine to go ahead and re@@ tri@@ eve them .
You could put your ho@@ lo@@ graphi@@ c T@@ es@@ la that you &apos;re sh@@ op@@ ping for -- or whatever model my legal team told me to put in right before the show .
Per@@ f@@ ect . And your brain knows exactly how to get it back .
The second interface gu@@ id@@ el@@ ine we call &quot; touch to see . &quot;
What do babies do when they see something that gr@@ ab@@ s their interest ?
They try and reach out and touch it .
And that &apos;s exactly how the natural machine should work as well .
Tur@@ ns out the visual system gets a fundamental boo@@ st from a sense we call propri@@ o@@ ception -- that &apos;s the sense of our body parts in space .
So by tou@@ ching our work directly , we &apos;re not only going to control it better , we &apos;re also going to understand it much more deeply .
H@@ ence , touch to see .
But it &apos;s not enough to experience things ourselves .
We &apos;re inher@@ ently these social prim@@ ates .
And this leads me to our third gu@@ id@@ el@@ ine , the ho@@ lo@@ graphi@@ c camp@@ fire from our first story .
Our mir@@ r@@ or@@ -@@ neur@@ on sub@@ system suggests that we can connect with each other and with our work much better if we can see each other &apos;s faces and hands in 3D .
So if you look at the video behind me , you can see two M@@ et@@ a users playing around with the same ho@@ lo@@ gram , making eye contact , connected around this thing , instead of being dis@@ trac@@ ted by ex@@ tern@@ al devices .
Let &apos;s go ahead and try this again with neuro@@ science in mind .
So again , our favorite interface , the i@@ O@@ S of the mind .
I &apos;m going to now take a step further and go ahead and gra@@ b this pair of gl@@ asses and leave it right here by the des@@ k .
I &apos;m now with you , I &apos;m in the moment , we &apos;re connec@@ ting .
My spatial memory k@@ ic@@ ks in , and I can go ahead and gra@@ b it and bring it right back here , re@@ min@@ ding me that I am the operating system .
And now my propri@@ o@@ ception is working , and I can go ahead and explo@@ de these gl@@ asses into a thousand parts and touch the very sens@@ or that is currently scann@@ ing my hand .
But it &apos;s not enough to see things alone , so in a second , my co-@@ f@@ oun@@ der R@@ ay is going to make a 3D call -- R@@ ay ?
Hey R@@ ay , how &apos;s it going ?
Gu@@ ys , I can see this guy in front me in full 3D .
And he is phot@@ o-@@ re@@ alis@@ tic .
Thank you .
My mir@@ r@@ or@@ -@@ neur@@ on sub@@ system suggests that this is going to re@@ place phones in not too long .
R@@ ay , how &apos;s it going ?
R@@ ay : Great . We &apos;re live today .
M@@ G : R@@ ay , give the crow@@ d a gi@@ ft of the ho@@ lo@@ graphi@@ c brain we saw from the video earlier .
Gu@@ ys , this is not only going to change phones , it &apos;s also going to change the way we collabor@@ ate .
Thank you so much .
Thanks , R@@ ay .
R@@ ay : You &apos;re wel@@ come .
M@@ G : So folks , this is the message that I discovered in that bar in 2011 : The future of computers is not loc@@ ked inside one of these scre@@ ens .
It &apos;s right here , inside of us .
So if there &apos;s one idea that I could leave you with here today , it &apos;s that the natural machine is not some fi@@ gment of the future , it &apos;s right here in 20@@ 16 .
Which is why all hundred of us at M@@ et@@ a , including the administr@@ ative staf@@ f , the ex@@ ec@@ uti@@ ves , the designers , the engineers -- before TED@@ 20@@ 17 , we &apos;re all going to be thro@@ wing away our ex@@ tern@@ al monit@@ ors and re@@ plac@@ ing them with a truly and prof@@ ound@@ ly more natural machine .
Thank you very much .
Thank you , appreci@@ ate it .
Thanks , guys .
Chris Anderson : So help me out on one thing , because there &apos;ve been a few augment@@ ed reality dem@@ os shown over the last year or so out there .
And there &apos;s sometimes a debate among techno@@ logists about , are we really seeing the real thing on-@@ screen ?
There &apos;s this issue of field of view , that somehow the technology is showing a broad@@ er view than you would actually see wearing the gl@@ asses .
W@@ ere we seeing the real deal there ?
M@@ G : Ab@@ solu@@ tely the real deal .
Not only that , we took extra mea@@ sures to sho@@ ot it with a Go@@ Pr@@ o through the actual l@@ ens in the various videos that you &apos;ve seen here .
We want to try to simul@@ ate the experience for the world that we &apos;re actually seeing through the gl@@ asses , and not cut any cor@@ ners .
CA : Thank you so much for showing us that .
M@@ G : Thanks so much , I appreci@@ ate that .
I come from one of the most liber@@ al , tol@@ er@@ ant , progr@@ essive places in the United States , Se@@ at@@ tle , Washington .
And I grew up with a family of great Se@@ att@@ lit@@ es .
My mother was an artist , my father was a college professor , and I am truly grat@@ eful for my up@@ bringing , because I always felt completely comfortable designing my life exactly as I saw fit .
And in point of fact , I took a route that was not exactly what my parents had in mind .
When I was 19 , I dro@@ pped out of college -- dro@@ pped out , k@@ ic@@ ked out , s@@ pl@@ itting h@@ airs .
And I went on the road as a professional French hor@@ n player , which was my li@@ fel@@ ong dream .
I played cham@@ ber music all over the United States and Europe , and I tou@@ red for a couple of years with a great j@@ az@@ z gu@@ it@@ ar player named Char@@ lie B@@ ird .
And by the end of my 20@@ s , I w@@ ound up as a member of the Bar@@ cel@@ on@@ a Sy@@ m@@ ph@@ ony Or@@ ches@@ tra in S@@ pain .
What a great life .
And you know , my parents never compl@@ ained .
They sup@@ ported me all the way through it .
It wasn &apos;t their dream .
They used to tell their neighb@@ ors and friends , &quot; Our son , he &apos;s taking a gap decade . &quot;
And -- There was , how@@ ever , one aw@@ k@@ ward conversation about my li@@ fes@@ ty@@ le that I want to tell you about .
I was 27 , and I was home from Bar@@ cel@@ on@@ a , and I was vis@@ iting my parents for Christ@@ mas , and I was coo@@ king dinner with my mother , and we were alone in the kitch@@ en .
And she was qui@@ et , too qui@@ et .
Some@@ thing was wrong .
And so I said , &quot; M@@ om , what &apos;s on your mind ? &quot;
And she said , &quot; Your dad and I are really worried about you . &quot;
And I said , &quot; What ? &quot; I mean , what could it be , at this point ?
And she said , &quot; I want you to be completely honest with me : have you been vot@@ ing for Re@@ public@@ ans ? &quot;
Now , the truth is , I wasn &apos;t really political , I was just a French hor@@ n player .
But I had a bit of an epi@@ ph@@ any , and they had det@@ ected it , and it was caus@@ ing some con@@ fusion .
You see , I had become an en@@ thu@@ si@@ ast for capitalis@@ m , and I want to tell you why that is .
It st@@ ems from a li@@ fel@@ ong interest of mine in , believe it or not , poverty .
See , when I was a kid growing up in Se@@ at@@ tle , I remember the first time I saw real poverty .
We were a lower middle class family , but that &apos;s of course not real poverty .
That &apos;s not even close .
The first time I saw poverty , and poverty &apos;s face , was when I was six or seven years old , early 197@@ 0s .
And it was like a lot of you , kind of a pro@@ sai@@ c example , kind of tr@@ ite .
It was a picture in the National Ge@@ ographic Mag@@ az@@ ine of a kid who was my age in East Africa , and there were flies on his face and a dist@@ ended bel@@ ly .
And he wasn &apos;t going to make it , and I knew that , and I was hel@@ pl@@ ess .
Some of you remember that picture , not exactly that picture , one just like it .
It introduced the West to gr@@ in@@ ding poverty around the world .
Well , that vision kind of hau@@ n@@ ted me as I grew up and I went to school and I dro@@ pped out and dro@@ pped in and started my family .
And I wonder@@ ed , what happened to that kid ?
Or to people just like him all over the world ?
And so I started to study , even though I wasn &apos;t in college , I was looking for the answer : what happened to the world &apos;s po@@ or@@ est people ?
H@@ as it gotten worse ? H@@ as it gotten better ? What ?
And I found the answer , and it changed my life , and I want to share it with you .
See -- most Americans believe that poverty has gotten worse since we were children , since they saw that vision .
If you ask Americans , &quot; H@@ as poverty gotten worse or better around the world ? &quot; , 70 percent will say that hun@@ ger has gotten worse since the early 197@@ 0s .
But here &apos;s the truth .
Here &apos;s the epi@@ ph@@ any that I had that changed my thinking .
From 19@@ 70 until today , the per@@ centage of the world &apos;s population living in star@@ vation levels , living on a dollar a day or less , obviously ad@@ just@@ ed for infl@@ ation , that per@@ centage has dec@@ lin@@ ed by 80 percent .
There &apos;s been an 80 percent dec@@ line in the world &apos;s worst poverty since I was a kid .
And I didn &apos;t even know about it .
This , my friends , that &apos;s a miracle .
That &apos;s something we ought to celebr@@ ate .
It &apos;s the greatest anti@@ poverty achiev@@ ement in the history of man@@ kind , and it happened in our life@@ times .
So when I learned this , I asked , what did that ? What made it possible ?
Because if you don &apos;t know why , you can &apos;t do it again .
If you want to replic@@ ate it and get the next two billion people out of poverty , because that &apos;s what we &apos;re talking about : since I was a kid , two billion of the least of these , our bro@@ thers and s@@ is@@ ters , have been pul@@ led out of poverty .
I want the next two billion , so I &apos;ve got to know why .
And I went in search of an answer .
And it wasn &apos;t a political answer , because I didn &apos;t care .
You know what , I still don &apos;t care .
I wanted the best answer from main@@ stream econom@@ ists left , right and center .
And here it is .
Here are the reasons .
There are five reasons that two billion of our bro@@ thers and s@@ is@@ ters have been pul@@ led out of poverty since I was a kid .
Num@@ ber one : glob@@ alization .
Num@@ ber two : free trade .
Num@@ ber three : property rights .
Num@@ ber four : rule of law .
Num@@ ber five : entrepren@@ eur@@ ship .
It was the free enter@@ prise system sp@@ reading around the world after 19@@ 70 that did that .
Now , I &apos;m not n@@ ai@@ ve .
I know that free enter@@ prise isn &apos;t perfect , and I know that free enter@@ prise isn &apos;t everything we need to build a better world .
But that is great .
And that &apos;s beyond politics .
Here &apos;s what I learned . This is the epi@@ ph@@ any .
Cap@@ it@@ alism is not just about accumul@@ ation .
At its best , it &apos;s about aspir@@ ation , which is what so many people on this stage talk about , is the aspir@@ ation that comes from dreams that are em@@ bed@@ ded in the free enter@@ prise system .
And we &apos;ve got to share it with more people .
Now , I want to tell you about a second epi@@ ph@@ any that &apos;s related to that first one that I think can bring us progress , not just around the world , but right here at home .
The best quote I &apos;ve ever heard to sum@@ mar@@ ize the thoughts that I &apos;ve just given you about pul@@ ling people out of poverty is as fol@@ lows : &quot; F@@ ree markets have created more wealth than any system in history .
They have lif@@ ted billions out of poverty . &quot;
Who said it ?
It sounds like Mil@@ ton Fri@@ ed@@ man or R@@ on@@ ald Re@@ ag@@ an .
W@@ r@@ ong .
President Bar@@ ack Obama said that .
Why do I know it by heart ?
Because he said it to me .
C@@ ra@@ z@@ y .
And I said , &quot; H@@ all@@ el@@ u@@ j@@ ah . &quot;
But more than that , I said , &quot; What an opportunity . &quot;
You know what I was thinking ?
It was at an event that we were doing on the subject at Ge@@ org@@ et@@ own University in M@@ ay of 20@@ 15 .
And I thought , this is the solution to the biggest problem facing America today . What ?
It &apos;s coming together around these ideas , liber@@ als and conserv@@ atives , to help people who need us the most .
Now , I don &apos;t have to tell anybody in this room that we &apos;re in a crisis , in America and many countries around the world with political pol@@ ar@@ ization .
It &apos;s ris@@ en to critical , crisis levels .
It &apos;s un@@ pl@@ eas@@ ant . It &apos;s not right .
There was an article last year in the Pro@@ ce@@ e@@ dings of the National Ac@@ adem@@ y of Sci@@ ences , which is one of the most pres@@ ti@@ gi@@ ous scientific journ@@ als published in the West .
And it was an article in 20@@ 14 on political mo@@ tive as@@ y@@ m@@ me@@ try .
What &apos;s that ? That &apos;s what psycho@@ logists call the phenomenon of as@@ sum@@ ing that your ide@@ ology is based in love but your op@@ pon@@ ents &apos; ide@@ ology is based in hate .
It &apos;s common in world conflict .
You expect to see this between Palest@@ ini@@ ans and Isra@@ el@@ is , for example .
What the auth@@ ors of this article found was that in America today , a majority of Re@@ public@@ ans and D@@ emo@@ cr@@ ats suff@@ er from political mo@@ tive as@@ y@@ m@@ me@@ try .
A majority of people in our country today who are poli@@ tically active believe that they are motiv@@ ated by love but the other side is motiv@@ ated by hate .
Think about it . Think about it .
Most people are walking around saying , &quot; You know , my ide@@ ology is based on basic ben@@ evol@@ ence , I want to help people , but the other guys , they &apos;re evil and out to get me . &quot;
You can &apos;t progress as a society when you have this kind of as@@ y@@ m@@ me@@ try .
It &apos;s impossible .
How do we solve it ?
Well , first , let &apos;s be honest : there are differences .
Let &apos;s not minim@@ ize the differences . That would be really n@@ a@@ ï@@ ve .
There &apos;s a lot of good research on this .
A v@@ eter@@ an of the TED stage is my friend Jon@@ athan Hai@@ d@@ t .
He &apos;s a psycho@@ logy professor at New York University .
He does work on the ide@@ ology and values and mor@@ als of different people to see how they diff@@ er .
And he &apos;s shown , for example , that conserv@@ atives and liber@@ als have a very different em@@ ph@@ as@@ is on what they think is important .
For example , J@@ on Hai@@ d@@ t has shown that liber@@ als care about poverty 5@@ 9 percent more than they care about economic liber@@ ty .
And conserv@@ atives care about economic liber@@ ty 28 percent more than they care about poverty .
I@@ r@@ re@@ conc@@ il@@ able differences , right ?
We &apos;ll never come together . W@@ r@@ ong .
That is diversity in which lies our strength .
Rem@@ ember what pul@@ led up the poor .
It was the obs@@ ession with poverty , ac@@ compan@@ i@@ ed by the method of economic freedom sp@@ reading around the world .
We need each other , in other words , if we want to help people and get the next two billion people out of poverty .
There &apos;s no other way .
How are we going to get that ?
It &apos;s a tric@@ ky thing , isn &apos;t it .
We need innov@@ ative thinking .
A lot of it &apos;s on this stage .
Soci@@ al entrepren@@ eur@@ ship . Yeah . Ab@@ solu@@ tely . Ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ al .
We need investment over@@ se@@ as in a sustainable , responsible , eth@@ ical and moral way . Yes . Yes .
But you know what we really need ?
We need a new day in flex@@ ible ide@@ ology .
We need to be less predic@@ table .
Don &apos;t we ?
Do you ever feel like your own ide@@ ology is starting to get predic@@ table ?
K@@ ind@@ a conventi@@ onal ?
Do you ever feel like you &apos;re always listening to people who agree with you ?
Why is that dangerous ?
Because when we talk in this country about economics , on the right , conserv@@ atives , you &apos;re always talking about tax@@ es and regul@@ ations and big government .
And on the left , liber@@ als , you &apos;re talking about economics , it &apos;s always about income inequality .
Right ? Now those are important things , really important to me , really important to you .
But when it comes to lif@@ ting people up who are star@@ ving and need us today , those are distr@@ actions .
We need to come together around the best ways to mi@@ ti@@ g@@ ate poverty using the best tools at our dispos@@ al , and that comes only when conserv@@ atives recognize that they need liber@@ als and their obs@@ ession with poverty , and liber@@ als need conserv@@ atives and their obs@@ ession with free markets .
That &apos;s the diversity in which lies the future strength of this country , if we choose to take it .
So how are we going to do it ? How are we going to do it together ?
I &apos;ve got to have some action it@@ ems , not just for you but for me .
Num@@ ber one . A@@ ction it@@ em number one : remember , it &apos;s not good enough just to tol@@ er@@ ate people who dis@@ agree .
It &apos;s not good enough .
We have to remember that we need people who dis@@ agree with us , because there are people who need all of us who are still waiting for these tools .
Now , what are you going to do ? How are you going to express that ?
Where does this start ? It starts here .
You know , all of us in this room , we &apos;re bl@@ essed .
We &apos;re bl@@ essed with people who listen to us .
We &apos;re bl@@ essed with pro@@ sper@@ ity . We &apos;re bl@@ essed with leadership .
When people hear us , with the kind of un@@ predic@@ table ide@@ ology , then maybe people will listen .
Maybe progress will start at that point .
That &apos;s number one . Num@@ ber two .
Num@@ ber two : I &apos;m asking you and I &apos;m asking me to be the person specifically who blu@@ rs the lines , who is ambi@@ gu@@ ous , who is hard to classi@@ fy .
If you &apos;re a conserv@@ ative , be the conserv@@ ative who is always going on about poverty and the moral oblig@@ ation to be a w@@ arri@@ or for the poor .
And if you &apos;re a liber@@ al , be a liber@@ al who is always talking about the beauty of free markets to solve our problems when we use them responsi@@ bly .
If we do that , we get two things .
Num@@ ber one : we get to start to work on the next two billion and be the solution that we &apos;ve seen so much of in the past and we need to see more of in the future . That &apos;s what we get .
And the second is that we might just be able to take the gh@@ as@@ tly ho@@ ly war of ide@@ ology that we &apos;re suffering under in this country and turn it into a competition of ideas based on soli@@ dar@@ ity and mu@@ tual respect .
And then maybe , just maybe , we &apos;ll all realize that our big differences aren &apos;t really that big after all .
Thank you .
So in college , I was a government major , which means I had to write a lot of pap@@ ers .
Now , when a normal student wr@@ ites a paper , they might spread the work out a little like this .
So , you know -- you get started maybe a little slowly , but you get enough done in the first week that , with some heav@@ ier days later on , everything gets done , things stay civil .
And I would want to do that like that .
That would be the plan . I would have it all ready to go , but then , actually , the paper would come along , and then I would kind of do this .
And that would happen every single paper .
But then came my 9@@ 0-@@ page sen@@ ior thesis , a paper you &apos;re supposed to spend a year on .
And I knew for a paper like that , my normal work flow was not an option .
So I plann@@ ed things out , and I decided I kind of had to go something like this .
This is how the year would go .
So I &apos;d start off light , and I &apos;d bu@@ mp it up in the middle months , and then at the end , I would k@@ ick it up into high g@@ ear just like a little st@@ air@@ case .
How hard could it be to walk up the st@@ airs ?
No big deal , right ?
But then , the fun@@ ni@@ est thing happened .
Those first few months ?
They came and went , and I couldn &apos;t quite do stuff .
So we had an awesome new re@@ vis@@ ed plan .
And then -- But then those middle months actually went by , and I didn &apos;t really write words , and so we were here .
And then two months turned into one month , which turned into two weeks .
And one day I w@@ oke up with three days until the dea@@ d@@ line , still not having written a word , and so I did the only thing I could : I wrote 90 pages over 7@@ 2 hours , pul@@ ling not one but two all@@ -@@ ni@@ gh@@ ters -- humans are not supposed to pull two all@@ -@@ ni@@ gh@@ ters -- s@@ prin@@ ted across campus , do@@ ve in slow motion , and got it in just at the dea@@ d@@ line .
I thought that was the end of everything .
But a week later I get a call , and it &apos;s the school .
And they say , &quot; Is this Ti@@ m U@@ r@@ ban ? &quot;
And I say , &quot; Yeah . &quot;
And they say , &quot; We need to talk about your thesis . &quot;
And I say , &quot; OK . &quot;
And they say , &quot; It &apos;s the best one we &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
That did not happen .
It was a very , very bad thesis .
I just wanted to enjoy that one moment when all of you thought , &quot; This guy is amazing ! &quot;
No , no , it was very , very bad .
Any@@ way , today I &apos;m a writ@@ er-@@ b@@ log@@ ger guy .
I write the blog W@@ ait But Why .
And a couple of years ago , I decided to write about pro@@ cr@@ as@@ tin@@ ation .
My behavior has always per@@ pl@@ ex@@ ed the non-@@ pro@@ cr@@ as@@ tin@@ ators around me , and I wanted to explain to the non-@@ pro@@ cr@@ as@@ tin@@ ators of the world what goes on in the heads of pro@@ cr@@ as@@ tin@@ ators , and why we are the way we are .
Now , I had a hypo@@ thesis that the brains of pro@@ cr@@ as@@ tin@@ ators were actually different than the brains of other people .
And to test this , I found an M@@ R@@ I lab that actually let me s@@ can both my brain and the brain of a pro@@ ven non-@@ pro@@ cr@@ as@@ tin@@ ator , so I could compare them .
I actually brought them here to show you today .
I want you to take a look carefully to see if you can notice a difference .
I know that if you &apos;re not a trained brain expert , it &apos;s not that obvious , but just take a look , OK ?
So here &apos;s the brain of a non-@@ pro@@ cr@@ as@@ tin@@ ator .
Now ...
here &apos;s my brain .
There is a difference .
B@@ oth brains have a R@@ ational D@@ ec@@ isi@@ on-@@ M@@ ak@@ er in them , but the pro@@ cr@@ as@@ tin@@ ator &apos;s brain also has an Inst@@ ant Gr@@ ati@@ fication Mon@@ key .
Now , what does this mean for the pro@@ cr@@ as@@ tin@@ ator ?
Well , it means everything &apos;s fine until this happens .
&#91; This is a perfect time to get some work done . &#93; &#91; N@@ ope ! &#93; So the R@@ ational D@@ ec@@ isi@@ on-@@ M@@ ak@@ er will make the rational decision to do something productive , but the Mon@@ key doesn &apos;t like that plan , so he actually takes the whe@@ el , and he says , &quot; Actually , let &apos;s read the entire Wikipedia page of the N@@ ancy K@@ er@@ ri@@ g@@ an / T@@ on@@ ya Har@@ ding sc@@ and@@ al , because I just rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ed that that happened .
Then -- Then we &apos;re going to go over to the fri@@ dge , to see if there &apos;s anything new in there since 10 minutes ago .
After that , we &apos;re going to go on a YouTube spir@@ al that starts with videos of Richard F@@ ey@@ n@@ man talking about mag@@ nets and ends much , much later with us watching intervie@@ ws with Jus@@ tin Bi@@ e@@ ber &apos;s mom .
&quot; All of that &apos;s going to take a while , so we &apos;re not going to really have room on the s@@ che@@ du@@ le for any work today . S@@ or@@ ry ! &quot;
Now , what is going on here ?
The Inst@@ ant Gr@@ ati@@ fication Mon@@ key does not seem like a guy you want behind the whe@@ el .
He lives entirely in the present moment .
He has no memory of the past , no knowledge of the future , and he only car@@ es about two things : easy and fun .
Now , in the animal world , that works fine .
If you &apos;re a dog and you spend your whole life doing nothing other than easy and fun things , you &apos;re a huge success !
And to the Mon@@ key , humans are just another animal species .
You have to keep well-@@ sle@@ pt , well-@@ f@@ ed and propag@@ ating into the next generation , which in trib@@ al times might have worked OK .
But , if you haven &apos;t noticed , now we &apos;re not in trib@@ al times .
We &apos;re in an advanced civilization , and the Mon@@ key does not know what that is .
Which is why we have another guy in our brain , the R@@ ational D@@ ec@@ isi@@ on-@@ M@@ ak@@ er , who gives us the ability to do things no other animal can do .
We can visu@@ alize the future .
We can see the big picture .
We can make long-term plans .
And he wants to take all of that into account .
And he wants to just have us do whatever makes sense to be doing right now .
Now , sometimes it makes sense to be doing things that are easy and fun , like when you &apos;re having dinner or going to bed or enjo@@ ying well-@@ ear@@ ned le@@ is@@ ure time .
That &apos;s why there &apos;s an over@@ la@@ p . Sometimes they agree .
But other times , it makes much more sense to be doing things that are harder and less pl@@ eas@@ ant , for the sa@@ ke of the big picture .
And that &apos;s when we have a conflict .
And for the pro@@ cr@@ as@@ tin@@ ator , that conflict t@@ ends to end a certain way every time , leaving him spending a lot of time in this orange zone , an easy and fun place that &apos;s entirely out of the Ma@@ kes S@@ ense circle .
I call it the Dar@@ k Pl@@ ay@@ ground .
Now , the Dar@@ k Pl@@ ay@@ ground is a place that all of you pro@@ cr@@ as@@ tin@@ ators out there know very well .
It &apos;s where le@@ is@@ ure acti@@ vi@@ ties happen at times when le@@ is@@ ure acti@@ vi@@ ties are not supposed to be happening .
The fun you have in the Dar@@ k Pl@@ ay@@ ground isn &apos;t actually fun , because it &apos;s completely un@@ ear@@ ned , and the air is filled with gu@@ il@@ t , dre@@ ad , anxi@@ ety , self-@@ h@@ at@@ red -- all of those good pro@@ cr@@ as@@ tin@@ ator feelings .
And the question is , in this situation , with the Mon@@ key behind the whe@@ el , how does the pro@@ cr@@ as@@ tin@@ ator ever get himself over here to this blue zone , a less pl@@ eas@@ ant place , but where really important things happen ?
Well , turns out the pro@@ cr@@ as@@ tin@@ ator has a gu@@ ar@@ di@@ an ang@@ el , someone who &apos;s always looking down on him and watching over him in his dark@@ est moments -- someone called the Pan@@ ic Mon@@ ster .
Now , the Pan@@ ic Mon@@ ster is dorm@@ ant most of the time , but he suddenly w@@ akes up any@@ time a dea@@ d@@ line gets too close or there &apos;s danger of public embarrass@@ ment , a career disaster or some other scar@@ y conse@@ quence .
And importantly , he &apos;s the only thing the Mon@@ key is terri@@ fied of .
Now , he became very relevant in my life pretty recently , because the people of TED reach@@ ed out to me about six months ago and invited me to do a TED Talk .
Now , of course , I said yes .
It &apos;s always been a dream of mine to have done a TED Talk in the past .
But in the middle of all this excit@@ ement , the R@@ ational D@@ ec@@ isi@@ on-@@ M@@ ak@@ er seemed to have something else on his mind .
He was saying , &quot; Are we clear on what we just accep@@ ted ?
Do we get what &apos;s going to be now happening one day in the future ?
We need to sit down and work on this right now . &quot;
And the Mon@@ key said , &quot; T@@ ot@@ ally agree , but let &apos;s just open Google Earth and zo@@ om in to the bottom of India , like 200 feet above the ground , and s@@ cro@@ ll up for two and a half hours til we get to the top of the country , so we can get a better feel for India . &quot;
So that &apos;s what we did that day .
As six months turned into four and then two and then one , the people of TED decided to release the spea@@ kers .
And I opened up the website , and there was my face star@@ ing right back at me .
And guess who w@@ oke up ?
So the Pan@@ ic Mon@@ ster starts losing his mind , and a few seconds later , the whole system &apos;s in may@@ h@@ em .
And the Mon@@ key -- remember , he &apos;s terri@@ fied of the Pan@@ ic Mon@@ ster -- bo@@ om , he &apos;s up the tree !
And finally , finally , the R@@ ational D@@ ec@@ isi@@ on-@@ M@@ ak@@ er can take the whe@@ el and I can start working on the talk .
Now , the Pan@@ ic Mon@@ ster expl@@ ains all kinds of pretty in@@ san@@ e pro@@ cr@@ as@@ tin@@ ator behavior , like how someone like me could spend two weeks un@@ able to start the opening sentence of a paper , and then mirac@@ ul@@ ously find the un@@ believ@@ able work eth@@ ic to stay up all night and write eight pages .
And this entire situation , with the three characters -- this is the pro@@ cr@@ as@@ tin@@ ator &apos;s system .
It &apos;s not pretty , but in the end , it works .
This is what I decided to write about on the blog a couple of years ago .
When I did , I was amaz@@ ed by the response .
L@@ iter@@ ally thousands of em@@ ails came in , from all different kinds of people from all over the world , doing all different kinds of things .
These are people who were nur@@ ses , ban@@ kers , pain@@ ters , engineers and lots and lots of Ph@@ D students .
And they were all writing , saying the same thing : &quot; I have this problem too . &quot;
But what struc@@ k me was the contr@@ ast between the light t@@ one of the pos@@ t and the heav@@ iness of these em@@ ails .
These people were writing with intense frustr@@ ation about what pro@@ cr@@ as@@ tin@@ ation had done to their lives , about what this Mon@@ key had done to them .
And I thought about this , and I said , well , if the pro@@ cr@@ as@@ tin@@ ator &apos;s system works , then what &apos;s going on ?
Why are all of these people in such a dark place ?
Well , it turns out that there &apos;s two kinds of pro@@ cr@@ as@@ tin@@ ation .
Everything I &apos;ve talked about today , the examples I &apos;ve given , they all have dea@@ d@@ lines .
And when there &apos;s dea@@ d@@ lines , the effects of pro@@ cr@@ as@@ tin@@ ation are cont@@ ained to the short term because the Pan@@ ic Mon@@ ster gets involved .
But there &apos;s a second kind of pro@@ cr@@ as@@ tin@@ ation that happens in situations when there is no dea@@ d@@ line .
So if you wanted a career where you &apos;re a self-@@ star@@ ter -- something in the arts , something entrepren@@ eu@@ ri@@ al -- there &apos;s no dea@@ d@@ lines on those things at first , because nothing &apos;s happening , not until you &apos;ve gone out and done the hard work to get mom@@ en@@ tum , get things going .
There &apos;s also all kinds of important things outside of your career that don &apos;t invol@@ ve any dea@@ d@@ lines , like seeing your family or exer@@ cis@@ ing and taking care of your health , working on your relationship or getting out of a relationship that isn &apos;t working .
Now if the pro@@ cr@@ as@@ tin@@ ator &apos;s only mechan@@ ism of doing these hard things is the Pan@@ ic Mon@@ ster , that &apos;s a problem , because in all of these non-@@ dea@@ d@@ line situations , the Pan@@ ic Mon@@ ster doesn &apos;t show up . He has nothing to wake up for , so the effects of pro@@ cr@@ as@@ tin@@ ation , they &apos;re not cont@@ ained ; they just ex@@ tend ou@@ tw@@ ard forever .
And it &apos;s this long-term kind of pro@@ cr@@ as@@ tin@@ ation that &apos;s much less visible and much less talked about than the fun@@ ni@@ er , shor@@ t-@@ term dea@@ d@@ lin@@ e-@@ based kind .
It &apos;s usually suff@@ ered qui@@ et@@ ly and priv@@ ately .
And it can be the source of a huge amount of long-term un@@ happiness , and regre@@ ts .
And I thought , that &apos;s why those people are em@@ ail@@ ing , and that &apos;s why they &apos;re in such a bad place .
It &apos;s not that they &apos;re cr@@ am@@ ming for some project .
It &apos;s that long-term pro@@ cr@@ as@@ tin@@ ation has made them feel like a spec@@ tat@@ or , at times , in their own lives .
The frustr@@ ation is not that they couldn &apos;t achieve their dreams ; it &apos;s that they weren &apos;t even able to start ch@@ as@@ ing them .
So I read these em@@ ails and I had a little bit of an epi@@ ph@@ any -- that I don &apos;t think non-@@ pro@@ cr@@ as@@ tin@@ ators exist .
That &apos;s right -- I think all of you are pro@@ cr@@ as@@ tin@@ ators .
Now , you might not all be a m@@ ess , like some of us , and some of you may have a healthy relationship with dea@@ d@@ lines , but remember : the Mon@@ key &apos;s sn@@ ea@@ ki@@ est trick is when the dea@@ d@@ lines aren &apos;t there .
Now , I want to show you one last thing .
I call this a Life Cal@@ end@@ ar .
That &apos;s one box for every week of a 9@@ 0-@@ year life .
That &apos;s not that many box@@ es , especially since we &apos;ve already used a bunch of those .
So I think we need to all take a long , hard look at that cal@@ end@@ ar .
We need to think about what we &apos;re really pro@@ cr@@ as@@ tin@@ ating on , because everyone is pro@@ cr@@ as@@ tin@@ ating on something in life .
We need to stay aware of the Inst@@ ant Gr@@ ati@@ fication Mon@@ key .
That &apos;s a job for all of us .
And because there &apos;s not that many box@@ es on there , it &apos;s a job that should probably start today .
Well , maybe not today , but ...
You know .
Some@@ time soon .
Thank you .
There we were , sou@@ ls and bodies p@@ acked into a Texas chur@@ ch on the last night of our lives .
P@@ acked into a room just like this , but with cre@@ ak@@ y woo@@ den pe@@ ws dr@@ ap@@ ed in wor@@ n@@ -@@ down red fabri@@ c , with an organ to my left and a cho@@ ir at my back and a b@@ ap@@ tis@@ m po@@ ol built into the wall behind them .
A room like this , non@@ eth@@ eless .
With the same great feelings of susp@@ ense , the same deep hop@@ es for sal@@ vation , the same swe@@ at in the pal@@ ms and the same people in the back not paying attention .
This was D@@ ec@@ ember 3@@ 1 , 199@@ 9 , the night of the Second Com@@ ing of Chris@@ t , and the end of the world as I knew it .
I had turned 12 that year and had reach@@ ed the age of accoun@@ t@@ ability .
And once I stopped compl@@ aining about how un@@ fair it was that J@@ es@@ us would return as soon as I had to be accoun@@ table for all that I had done , I figured I had better get my house in order very quickly .
So I went to chur@@ ch as often as I could .
I listen@@ ed for silence as anxi@@ ously as one might listen for noise , trying to be sure that the L@@ ord hadn &apos;t pul@@ led a fast one on me and decided to come back early .
And just in case he did , I built a back@@ up plan , by reading the &quot; Le@@ ft Be@@ h@@ ind &quot; books that were all the r@@ age at the time .
And I found in their pages that if I was not taken in the rap@@ ture at mid@@ night , I had another shot .
All I had to do was avoid taking the mark of the be@@ ast , fight off dem@@ ons , pl@@ agues and the An@@ ti@@ ch@@ ris@@ t himself .
It would be hard -- but I knew I could do it .
But planning time was over now .
It was 11 : 5@@ 0@@ p@@ m .
We had 10 minutes left , and my pas@@ tor called us out of the pe@@ ws and down to the al@@ t@@ ar because he wanted to be pr@@ aying when mid@@ night struc@@ k .
So every fac@@ tion of the con@@ gre@@ gation took its place .
The cho@@ ir st@@ ayed in the cho@@ ir stand , the de@@ ac@@ ons and their wi@@ ves -- or the B@@ ap@@ ti@@ st B@@ our@@ ge@@ o@@ is@@ ie as I like to call them -- took first position in front of the al@@ t@@ ar .
You see , in America , even the Second Com@@ ing of Chris@@ t has a V@@ I@@ P section .
And right behind the B@@ ap@@ ti@@ st B@@ our@@ ge@@ o@@ is@@ ie were the el@@ der@@ ly -- these men and women whose young b@@ acks had been b@@ ent under hot su@@ ns in the cot@@ ton fields of East Texas , and whose skin seemed to be bur@@ n@@ t a cre@@ as@@ eless no@@ ble bro@@ wn , just like the cl@@ ay of East Texas , and whose hop@@ es and dreams for what life might become outside of East Texas had sometimes been b@@ ent and broken
even further than their b@@ acks .
Yes , these men and women were the stars of the show for me .
They had wai@@ ted their whole lives for this moment , just as their medi@@ ev@@ al pre@@ dec@@ ess@@ ors had long@@ ed for the end of the world , and just as my grandmother wai@@ ted for the O@@ pr@@ ah W@@ inf@@ re@@ y S@@ how to come on Ch@@ an@@ nel 8 every day at 4 o &apos;@@ clock .
And as she made her way to the al@@ t@@ ar , I s@@ nu@@ ck right in behind her , because I knew for sure that my grandmother was going to heav@@ en .
And I thought that if I held on to her hand during this pr@@ ay@@ er , I might go right on with her .
So I held on and I closed my eyes to listen , to wait .
And the pr@@ ay@@ ers got lou@@ der .
And the sh@@ ou@@ ts of response to the call of the pr@@ ay@@ er went up higher even still .
And the organ rol@@ led on in to add the dir@@ ge .
And the heat came on to add to the swe@@ at .
And my hand gri@@ pped fir@@ mer , so I wouldn &apos;t be the one left in the field .
My eyes cl@@ en@@ ched ti@@ ghter so I wouldn &apos;t see the whe@@ at being separ@@ ated from the ch@@ af@@ f .
And then a voice ran@@ g out above us : &quot; A@@ men . &quot;
It was over .
I looked at the clock .
It was after mid@@ night .
I looked at the el@@ der believ@@ ers whose sav@@ ior had not come , who were too proud to show any signs of dis@@ ap@@ po@@ int@@ ment , who had believed too much and for too long to start doub@@ ting now .
But I was up@@ set on their be@@ half .
They had been du@@ ped , ho@@ od@@ win@@ ked , b@@ am@@ boo@@ z@@ led , and I had gone right along with them .
I had pr@@ ayed their pr@@ ay@@ ers , I had y@@ i@@ el@@ ded not to temp@@ tation as best I could .
I had di@@ pped my head not once , but twice in that s@@ not@@ -@@ in@@ duc@@ ing b@@ ap@@ tis@@ m po@@ ol .
I had believed .
Now what ?
I got home just in time to turn on the television and watch Peter J@@ enn@@ ings ann@@ oun@@ ce the new mill@@ enni@@ um as it rol@@ led in around the world .
It struc@@ k me that it would have been strange anyway , for J@@ es@@ us to come back again and again based on the different time zones .
And this made me feel even more ridi@@ cul@@ ous -- hur@@ t , really .
But there on that night , I did not stop believ@@ ing .
I just believed a new thing : that it was possible not to believe .
It was possible the answers I had were wrong , that the questions themselves were wrong .
And now , where there was once a mountain of cer@@ ti@@ tu@@ de , there was , running right down to its foundation , a spring of doub@@ t , a spring that prom@@ is@@ ed ri@@ vers .
I can trace the whole dr@@ ama of my life back to that night in that chur@@ ch when my sav@@ ior did not come for me ; when the thing I believed most certainly turned out to be , if not a lie , then not quite the truth .
And even though most of you prepar@@ ed for Y@@ 2@@ K in a very different way , I &apos;m convinced that you are here because some part of you has done the same thing that I have done since the d@@ a@@ wn of this new century , since my mother left and my father st@@ ayed away and my L@@ ord ref@@ used to come .
And I held out my hand , reach@@ ing for something to believe in .
I held on when I arrived at Y@@ ale at 18 , with the faith that my journey from O@@ ak C@@ li@@ ff , Texas was a chance to leave behind all the challenges I had known , the broken dreams and broken bodies I had seen .
But when I found myself back home one win@@ ter break , with my face plan@@ ted in the floor , my hands ti@@ ed behind my back and a bur@@ gl@@ ar &apos;s gun pressed to my head , I knew that even the best education couldn &apos;t save me .
I held on when I showed up at Le@@ h@@ man Bro@@ thers as an inter@@ n in 2008 .
So hop@@ eful -- that I called home to in@@ form my family that we &apos;d never be poor again .
But as I wit@@ n@@ essed this temp@@ le of finance come cr@@ ash@@ ing down before my eyes , I knew that even the best job couldn &apos;t save me .
I held on when I showed up in Washington D@@ C as a young st@@ aff@@ er , who had heard a voice call out from I@@ l@@ lin@@ ois , saying , &quot; It &apos;s been a long time coming , but in this el@@ ection , change has come to America . &quot;
But as the Congr@@ ess ground to a hal@@ t and the country ri@@ pped at the se@@ ams and hope and change began to feel like a cru@@ el jo@@ ke , I knew that even the political second coming could not save me .
I had k@@ n@@ el@@ t fai@@ th@@ fully at the al@@ t@@ ar of the American D@@ re@@ am , pr@@ aying to the go@@ ds of my time of success , and money , and power .
But over and over again , mid@@ night struc@@ k , and I opened my eyes to see that all of these go@@ ds were dead .
And from that grav@@ ey@@ ard , I began the search once more , not because I was br@@ ave , but because I knew that I would either believe or I would die .
So I took a pil@@ gri@@ mage to yet another m@@ ec@@ ca , Harvard B@@ us@@ iness School -- this time , knowing that I could not simply accept the sal@@ vation that it cl@@ aim@@ ed to offer .
No , I knew there &apos;d be more work to do .
The work began in the dark corner of a crow@@ ded party , in the late night of an early , mis@@ er@@ able Cam@@ bridge win@@ ter , when three friends and I asked a question that young folks se@@ arch@@ ing for something real have asked for a very long time : &quot; What if we took a road trip ? &quot;
We didn &apos;t know where &apos;d we go or how we &apos;d get there , but we knew we had to do it .
Because all our lives we year@@ ned , as J@@ ack K@@ er@@ ou@@ ac wrote , to &quot; sn@@ ea@@ k out into the night and dis@@ appear somewhere , &quot; and go find out what everybody was doing all over the country .
So even though there were other voices who said that the risk was too great and the pro@@ of too thin , we went on any@@ how .
We went on 8@@ ,000 miles across America in the summer of 20@@ 13 , through the co@@ w pas@@ tures of Mon@@ t@@ ana , through the des@@ ol@@ ation of De@@ tro@@ it , through the sw@@ am@@ ps of New Or@@ le@@ ans , where we found and worked with men and women who were building small businesses that made purpose their bottom line .
And having been trained at the West Po@@ int of capitalis@@ m , this struc@@ k us as a re@@ volu@@ tionary idea .
And this idea spread , growing into a non@@ profit called M@@ B@@ As A@@ cross America , a movement that land@@ ed me here on this stage today .
It spread because we found a great hun@@ ger in our generation for purpose , for meaning .
It spread because we found coun@@ t@@ less entrepreneurs in the no@@ o@@ ks and cr@@ an@@ nies of America who were creating jobs and changing lives and who needed a little help .
But if I &apos;m being honest , it also spread because I f@@ ought to spread it .
There was no l@@ ength to which I would not go to pre@@ ach this go@@ spe@@ l , to get more people to believe that we could b@@ ind the w@@ ounds of a broken country , one social business at a time .
But it was this journey of ev@@ ang@@ el@@ ism that led me to the rather different go@@ spe@@ l that I &apos;ve come to share with you today .
It began one even@@ ing almost a year ago at the Museum of N@@ atu@@ ral H@@ ist@@ ory in New York City , at a gal@@ a for al@@ um@@ ni of Harvard B@@ us@@ iness School .
Un@@ der a ful@@ l@@ -@@ size replic@@ a of a wh@@ ale , I sat with the tit@@ ans of our time as they celebr@@ ated their pe@@ ers and their good dee@@ ds .
There was pri@@ de in a room where net worth and asse@@ ts under management sur@@ passed half a trillion dollars .
We looked over all that we had made , and it was good .
But it just so happened , two days later , I had to travel up the road to Har@@ lem , where I found myself sitting in an urban farm that had once been a vac@@ ant lot , listening to a man named T@@ ony tell me of the kids that showed up there every day .
All of them lived below the poverty line .
Many of them car@@ ried all of their bel@@ ong@@ ings in a back@@ p@@ ack to avoid losing them in a hom@@ eless shel@@ ter .
Some of them came to T@@ ony &apos;s program , called Har@@ lem Gro@@ wn , to get the only me@@ al they had each day .
T@@ ony told me that he started Har@@ lem Gro@@ wn with money from his pen@@ sion , after 20 years as a ca@@ b driver .
He told me that he didn &apos;t give himself a sal@@ ary , because despite success , the program stru@@ ggl@@ ed for resources .
He told me that he would take any help that he could get .
And I was there as that help .
But as I left T@@ ony , I felt the sting and sal@@ t of t@@ ears w@@ elling up in my eyes .
I felt the weight of re@@ vel@@ ation that I could sit in one room on one night , where a few hundred people had half a trillion dollars , and another room , two days later , just 50 blocks up the road , where a man was going without a sal@@ ary to get a child her only me@@ al of the day .
And it wasn &apos;t the gl@@ ar@@ ing inequality that made me want to cr@@ y , it wasn &apos;t the thought of hun@@ gry , hom@@ eless kids , it wasn &apos;t r@@ age toward the one percent or p@@ ity toward the 99 .
No , I was dis@@ tur@@ bed because I had finally realized that I was the di@@ aly@@ sis for a country that needed a kid@@ ney trans@@ plant .
I realized that my story stood in for all those who were expected to pick themselves up by their bo@@ ot@@ str@@ aps , even if they didn &apos;t have any bo@@ ots ; that my organization stood in for all the struc@@ tural , syst@@ em@@ ic help that never went to Har@@ lem or Ap@@ pal@@ ach@@ ia or the Lo@@ wer 9@@ th W@@ ard ; that my voice stood in for all those voices that seemed too un@@ learned , too un@@ wash@@ ed , too un@@ ac@@ com@@ mod@@ ated .
And the sh@@ ame of that , that sh@@ ame wash@@ ed over me like the sh@@ ame of sitting in front of the television , watching Peter J@@ enn@@ ings ann@@ oun@@ ce the new mill@@ enni@@ um again and again and again .
I had been du@@ ped , ho@@ od@@ win@@ ked , b@@ am@@ boo@@ z@@ led .
But this time , the fal@@ se sav@@ ior was me .
You see , I &apos;ve come a long way from that al@@ t@@ ar on the night I thought the world would end , from a world where people spoke in ton@@ gues and saw suffering as a necessary act of God and took a text to be inf@@ alli@@ ble truth .
Yes , I &apos;ve come so far that I &apos;m right back where I started .
Because it simply is not true to say that we live in an age of dis@@ belief -- no , we believe today just as much as any time that came before .
Some of us may believe in the pro@@ ph@@ ec@@ y of B@@ ren@@ é Bro@@ wn or T@@ ony Rob@@ b@@ ins .
We may believe in the bi@@ ble of The New Yor@@ ker or the Harvard B@@ us@@ iness R@@ ev@@ i@@ ew .
We may believe most deeply when we wor@@ ship right here at the chur@@ ch of TED , but we des@@ per@@ ately want to believe , we need to believe .
We speak in the ton@@ gues of char@@ is@@ mati@@ c leaders that promise to solve all our problems .
We see suffering as a necessary act of the capitalis@@ m that is our go@@ d , we take the text of techno@@ logical progress to be inf@@ alli@@ ble truth .
And we har@@ dly realize the human price we pay when we fail to question one bri@@ ck , because we fear it might sh@@ ake our whole foundation .
But if you are dis@@ tur@@ bed by the un@@ consci@@ on@@ able things that we have come to accept , then it must be ques@@ tioning time .
So I have not a go@@ spe@@ l of dis@@ ru@@ ption or innovation or a tri@@ ple bottom line .
I do not have a go@@ spe@@ l of faith to share with you today , in fact .
I have and I offer a go@@ spe@@ l of doub@@ t .
The go@@ spe@@ l of doub@@ t does not ask that you stop believ@@ ing , it asks that you believe a new thing : that it is possible not to believe .
It is possible the answers we have are wrong , it is possible the questions themselves are wrong .
Yes , the go@@ spe@@ l of doub@@ t means that it is possible that we , on this stage , in this room , are wrong .
Because it rai@@ ses the question , &quot; Why ? &quot;
With all the power that we hold in our hands , why are people still suffering so bad ?
This doub@@ t leads me to share that we are putting my organization , M@@ B@@ As A@@ cross America , out of business .
We have sh@@ ed our staf@@ f and closed our do@@ ors and we will share our model fre@@ ely with anyone who sees their power to do this work without waiting for our per@@ mission .
This doub@@ t comp@@ els me to ren@@ oun@@ ce the role of sav@@ ior that some have placed on me , because our time is too short and our od@@ ds are too long to wait for second com@@ ings , when the truth is that there will be no mirac@@ les here .
And this doub@@ t , it fu@@ els me , it gives me hope that when our trou@@ bles over@@ wh@@ el@@ m us , when the path@@ s l@@ aid out for us seem to lead to our dem@@ ise , when our heal@@ ers bring no com@@ fort to our w@@ ounds , it will not be our blind faith -- no , it will be our hum@@ ble doub@@ t that sh@@ ines a little light into the dark@@ ness of our lives and of our world and lets us raise our voice to wh@@ is@@ per
or to sh@@ out or to say simply , very simply , &quot; There must be another way . &quot;
Thank you .
F@@ ood crisis .
It &apos;s in the news every day .
But what is it ?
Some places in the world it &apos;s too little food , maybe too much .
O@@ ther places , G@@ M@@ O is saving the world .
Maybe G@@ M@@ O is the problem ?
To@@ o much agri@@ cultural ru@@ no@@ ff creating bad oceans , tox@@ ic oceans , atten@@ u@@ ation of nutrition .
They go on and on .
And I find the current climate of this discussion incredibly dis@@ em@@ power@@ ing .
So how do we bring that to something that we understand ?
How is this app@@ le food crisis ?
You &apos;ve all e@@ at@@ en an app@@ le in the last week , I &apos;m sure .
How old do you think it was from when it was picked ?
Two weeks ?
Two months ?
El@@ even months -- the average age of an app@@ le in a gro@@ cer@@ y store in the United States .
And I don &apos;t expect it to be much different in Europe or anywhere else in the world .
We pick them , we put them in cold stor@@ age , we gas the cold stor@@ age -- there &apos;s actually document@@ ed pro@@ of of workers trying to go into these environments to re@@ tri@@ eve an app@@ le , and dying , because the atmosphere that they slow down the process of the app@@ le with is also tox@@ ic to humans .
How is it that none of you knew this ?
Why didn &apos;t I know this ?
N@@ in@@ ety percent of the quality of that app@@ le -- all of the anti@@ ox@@ id@@ ants -- are gone by the time we get it .
It &apos;s basically a little ball of su@@ gar .
How did we get so information poor and how can we do better ?
I think what &apos;s missing is a platform .
I know plat@@ forms -- I know computers , they put me on the Internet when I was young .
I did very weird things -- on this platform .
But I met people , and I could express myself .
How do you express yourself in food ?
If we had a platform , we might feel em@@ powered to question : What if ?
For me , I ques@@ tion@@ ed : What if climate was demo@@ cratic ?
So , this is a map of climate in the world .
The most productive areas in green , the least productive in red .
They shift and they change , and C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ an farmers now become Mexic@@ an farmers .
China pic@@ ks up land in Brazil to grow better food , and we &apos;re a sl@@ ave to climate .
What if each country had its own productive climate ?
What would that change about how we live ?
What would that change about quality of life and nutrition ?
The last generation &apos;s problem was , we need more food and we need it cheap .
W@@ el@@ come to your global farm .
We built a huge analo@@ g farm .
All these tr@@ aces -- these are cars , plan@@ es , tr@@ ains and automobi@@ les .
It &apos;s a miracle that we feed seven billion people with just a few of us involved in the production of food .
What if ...
we built a digital farm ?
A digital world farm .
What if you could take this app@@ le , di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze it somehow , send it through particles in the air and re@@ constitu@@ te it on the other side ?
What if ?
Go@@ ing through some of these quot@@ es , you know , they inspire me to do what I do .
First one : &#91; &quot; Japanese farm@@ ing has no y@@ ou@@ th , no water , no land and no future . &quot; &#93; That &apos;s what I land@@ ed to the day that I went to Min@@ am@@ is@@ an@@ ri@@ k@@ u , one stop south of F@@ u@@ k@@ ush@@ im@@ a , after the disaster .
The kids have hea@@ ded to S@@ end@@ ai and To@@ ky@@ o , the land is cont@@ amin@@ ated , they already im@@ port 70 percent of their own food .
But it &apos;s not unique to Japan .
Two percent of the American population is involved in farm@@ ing .
What good answer comes from two percent of any population ?
As we go around the world , 50 percent of the African population is under 18 .
E@@ igh@@ ty percent don &apos;t want to be farmers .
F@@ arm@@ ing is hard .
The life of a small@@ -@@ sh@@ are@@ hol@@ der far@@ mer is mis@@ er@@ able .
They go into the city .
In India : farmers &apos; families not being able to have basic access to uti@@ lities , more far@@ mer su@@ ici@@ des this year and the previ@@ ous 10 before that .
It &apos;s un@@ comfortable to talk about .
Where are they going ?
In@@ to the city .
No young people , and everyone &apos;s hea@@ ded in .
So how do we build this platform that insp@@ ires the y@@ ou@@ th ?
W@@ el@@ come to the new tr@@ actor .
This is my combine .
A number of years ago now , I went to B@@ ed B@@ ath and B@@ ey@@ ond and H@@ ome De@@ po@@ t and I started h@@ acking .
And I built sil@@ ly things and I made plants dance and I atta@@ ched them to my computer and I killed them all -- a lot .
I eventually got them to survive .
And I created one of the most in@@ timate relationships I &apos;ve ever had in my life , because I was learning the language of plants .
I wanted to make it bigger .
They said , &quot; K@@ no@@ ck yourself out , kid !
Here &apos;s an old electron@@ ics room that nobody wants .
What can you do ? &quot;
With my team , we built a farm inside of the media lab , a place histor@@ ically known not for anything about biology but everything about digital life .
In@@ side of these 60 square feet , we produced enough food to feed about 300 people once a month -- not a lot of food .
And there &apos;s a lot of interesting technology in there .
But the most interesting thing ?
Beau@@ ti@@ ful , white ro@@ ots , deep , green colors and a mon@@ th@@ ly har@@ v@@ est .
Is this a new caf@@ et@@ eria ?
Is this a new ret@@ ail experience ?
Is this a new gro@@ cer@@ y store ?
I can tell you one thing for sure : this is the first time anybody in the media lab ri@@ pped the ro@@ ots off of anything .
We get our sal@@ ad in b@@ ags ; there &apos;s nothing wrong with that .
But what happens when you have an imag@@ e-@@ based proc@@ essing expert , a data scientist , a robo@@ tic@@ ist , ri@@ pping ro@@ ots off and thinking , &quot; Hu@@ h . I know something about -- I could make this happen , I want to try . &quot;
In that process we would bring the plants out and we would take some back to the lab , because if you grew it , you don &apos;t throw it away ; it &apos;s kind of pre@@ ci@@ ous to you .
I have this weird ton@@ gue now , because I &apos;m afraid to let anybody eat anything until I &apos;ve e@@ at@@ en it first , because I want it to be good .
So I eat let@@ tu@@ ce every day and I can tell the p@@ H of a let@@ tu@@ ce within .@@ 1 .
I &apos;m like , &quot; No , that &apos;s 6@@ .@@ 1 -- no , no , you can &apos;t eat it today . &quot;
This let@@ tu@@ ce that day was hy@@ per swe@@ et .
It was hy@@ per swe@@ et because the plant had been str@@ essed and it created a chemical reaction in the plant to protect itself : &quot; I &apos;m not going to die ! &quot;
And the plants not@@ -@@ go@@ ing-@@ to-@@ die , tas@@ te swe@@ et to me .
T@@ echno@@ logists fall@@ ing back@@ wards into plant physi@@ ology .
So we thought other people needed to be able to try this .
We want to see what people can create , so we con@@ ce@@ ived of a lab that could be shi@@ pped anywhere .
And then we built it .
So on the fac@@ ade of the media lab is my lab , that has about 30 points of sen@@ sing per plant .
If you know about the genome or gene@@ tics , this is the phen@@ ome , right ?
The phenomen@@ a .
When you say , &quot; I like the str@@ aw@@ ber@@ ries from Mexico , &quot; you really like the str@@ aw@@ ber@@ ries from the climate that produced the expression that you like .
So if you &apos;re co@@ ding climate -- this much CO2 , this much O@@ 2 creates a reci@@ pe -- you &apos;re co@@ ding the expression of that plant , the nutrition of that plant , the size of that plant , the shape , the color , the tex@@ ture .
We need data , so we put a bunch of sens@@ ors in there to tell us what &apos;s going on .
If you think of your hou@@ se@@ plants , and you look at your hou@@ se@@ plant and you &apos;re super sad , because you &apos;re like , &quot; Why are you dying ? W@@ on &apos;t you talk to me ? &quot;
F@@ arm@@ ers develop the most beautiful for@@ tu@@ ne@@ -@@ telling eyes by the time they &apos;re in their late 6@@ 0s and 7@@ 0s .
They can tell you when you see that plant dying that it &apos;s a ni@@ tro@@ gen de@@ fici@@ ency , a cal@@ ci@@ um de@@ fici@@ ency or it needs more hu@@ mid@@ ity .
Those beautiful eyes are not being passed down .
These are eyes in the cloud of a far@@ mer .
We tr@@ end those data points over time .
We cor@@ rel@@ ate those data points to individual plants .
These are all the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i in my lab that day , by I@@ P address .
We have I@@ P@@ -@@ ad@@ dr@@ ess@@ able bro@@ c@@ col@@ i .
So if that &apos;s not weird enough , you can click one and you get a plant pro@@ file .
And what this tells you is down@@ lo@@ ad@@ able progress on that plant , but not like you &apos;d think , it &apos;s not just when it &apos;s ready .
When does it achieve the nutrition that I need ?
When does it achieve the tas@@ te that I desire ?
Is it getting too much water ?
Is it getting too much sun ?
Al@@ er@@ ts .
It can talk to me , it &apos;s convers@@ ant , we have a language .
I think of that as the first user on the plant Facebook , right ?
That &apos;s a plant pro@@ file and that plant will start making friends .
And I mean it -- it will make friends with other plants that use less ni@@ tro@@ gen , more pho@@ sp@@ hor@@ us , less po@@ tas@@ si@@ um .
We &apos;re going to learn about a complexity that we can only guess at now .
And they may not friend us back -- I don &apos;t know , they might friend us back , it depends on how we act .
So this is my lab now .
It &apos;s a little bit more syst@@ em@@ ati@@ zed , my background is designing data centers in hospitals of all things , so I know a little bit about creating a controlled environment .
And so -- inside of this environment , we &apos;re experim@@ enting with all kinds of things .
This process , a@@ ero@@ pon@@ ics , was developed by NASA for M@@ ir Sp@@ ace St@@ ation for re@@ duc@@ ing the amount of water they send into space .
What it really does is give the plant exactly what it wants : water , min@@ er@@ als and oxygen .
Ro@@ ots are not that complicated , so when you give them that , you get this amazing expression .
It &apos;s like the plant has two hear@@ ts .
And because it has two hear@@ ts , it gro@@ ws four or five times faster .
It &apos;s a perfect world .
We &apos;ve gone a long way into technology and se@@ ed for an ad@@ verse world and we &apos;re going to continue to do that , but we &apos;re going to have a new tool , too , which is perfect world .
So we &apos;ve grown all kinds of things .
These tom@@ ato@@ es hadn &apos;t been in commercial production for 150 years .
Do you know that we have rare and ancient se@@ ed ban@@ ks ?
B@@ anks of se@@ ed .
It &apos;s amazing .
They have ger@@ m@@ plas@@ m alive and things that you &apos;ve never e@@ at@@ en .
I am the only person in this room that &apos;s e@@ at@@ en that kind of tom@@ a@@ to .
P@@ rob@@ lem is it was a sau@@ ce tom@@ a@@ to and we don &apos;t know how to co@@ ok , so we ate a sau@@ ce tom@@ a@@ to , which is not that great .
But we &apos;ve done things with protein -- we &apos;ve grown all kinds of things .
We &apos;ve grown humans -- Well maybe you could , but we didn &apos;t .
But what we realized is , the tool was too big , it was too expensive .
I was starting to put them around the world and they were about 100,000 dollars .
Fin@@ ding somebody with 100 grand in their back po@@ cket isn &apos;t easy , so we wanted to make a small one .
This project was actually one of my student &apos;s -- mechan@@ ical engineering under@@ graduate , Cam@@ ille .
So Cam@@ ille and I and my team , we iter@@ ated all summer , how to make it che@@ aper , how to make it work better , how to make it so other people can make it .
Then we dro@@ pped them off in schools , sev@@ ent@@ h through el@@ ev@@ ent@@ h grade .
And if you want to be hum@@ bl@@ ed , try to teach a kid something .
So I went into this school and I said , &quot; S@@ et it to 65 percent hu@@ mid@@ ity . &quot;
The sev@@ ent@@ h grad@@ er said , &quot; What &apos;s hu@@ mid@@ ity ? &quot;
And I said , &quot; Oh , it &apos;s water in air . &quot;
He said , &quot; There &apos;s no water in air , you &apos;re an idi@@ ot . &quot;
And I was like , &quot; Al@@ right , don &apos;t trust me .
Actually -- don &apos;t trust me , right ?
S@@ et it to 100 .
He sets it to 100 and what happens ?
It starts to con@@ dense , make a fo@@ g and eventually dri@@ p .
And he says , &quot; Oh . Hu@@ mid@@ ity is rain .
Why didn &apos;t you just tell me that ? &quot;
We &apos;ve created an interface for this that &apos;s much like a game .
They have a 3D environment , they can lo@@ g into it anywhere in the world on their smart@@ phone , on their tab@@ let .
They have different parts of the b@@ ots -- the physical , the sens@@ ors .
They sel@@ ect re@@ cip@@ es that have been created by other kids anywhere in the world .
They sel@@ ect and activ@@ ate that reci@@ pe , they plant a se@@ ed@@ ling .
While it &apos;s growing , they make changes .
They &apos;re like , &quot; Why does a plant need CO2 anyway ? Is@@ n &apos;t CO2 bad ?
It kill@@ s people . &quot;
C@@ r@@ ank up CO2 , plant dies .
Or cr@@ ank down CO2 , plant does very well .
Harv@@ est plant , and you &apos;ve created a new digital reci@@ pe .
It &apos;s an iter@@ ative design and development and exploration process .
They can down@@ load , then , all of the data about that new plant that they developed or the new digital reci@@ pe and what did it do -- was it better or was it worse ?
Imagine these as little cor@@ es of proc@@ essing .
We &apos;re going to learn so much .
Here &apos;s one of the food computers , as we call them , in a school in three weeks &apos; time .
This is three weeks of growth .
But more importantly , it was the first time that this kid ever thought he could be a far@@ mer -- or that he would want to be a far@@ mer .
So , we &apos;ve open-@@ sour@@ c@@ ed all of this .
It &apos;s all online ; go home , try to build your first food computer .
It &apos;s going to be difficult -- I &apos;m just telling you .
We &apos;re in the beginning , but it &apos;s all there .
It &apos;s very important to me that this is easily accessible .
We &apos;re going to keep making it more so .
These are farmers , electrical engineer , mechan@@ ical engineer , environmental engineer , computer scientist , plant scientist , econom@@ ist , urban plann@@ ers .
On one platform , doing what they &apos;re good at .
But we got a little too big .
This is my new facil@@ ity that I &apos;m just starting .
This w@@ are@@ house could be anywhere .
That &apos;s why I chose it .
And inside of this w@@ are@@ house we &apos;re going to build something kind of like this .
These exist right now .
Take a look at it .
These exist , too .
One gro@@ ws gre@@ ens , one gro@@ ws Ebola vacc@@ ine .
P@@ ret@@ ty amazing that plants and this D@@ AR@@ PA Grand Ch@@ all@@ enge win@@ ner is one of the reasons we &apos;re getting ahead of Ebola .
The plants are producing the protein that &apos;s Ebola res@@ istant .
So pharmaceu@@ tic@@ als , nu@@ trac@@ eu@@ tic@@ als , all they way down to let@@ tu@@ ce .
But these two things look nothing ali@@ ke , and that &apos;s where I am with my field .
Everything is different .
We &apos;re in that weird &quot; We &apos;re al@@ right &quot; stage and it &apos;s like , &quot; Here &apos;s my black box -- &quot; &quot; No , buy mine . &quot;
&quot; No , no , no -- I &apos;ve got intellectu@@ al property that &apos;s totally valuable .
Don &apos;t buy his , buy mine . &quot;
And the reality is , we &apos;re just at the beginning , in a time when society is shif@@ ting , too .
When we ask for more , che@@ aper food , we &apos;re now asking for better , environ@@ ment@@ ally friend@@ ly food .
And when you have Mc@@ Don@@ ald &apos;s adver@@ tis@@ ing what &apos;s in the Chic@@ ken Mc@@ N@@ u@@ g@@ get , the most myst@@ er@@ ious food it@@ em of all time -- they are now bas@@ ing their marketing plan on that -- everything is changing .
So into the world now .
Per@@ s@@ onal food computers , food ser@@ vers and food data centers run on the open phen@@ ome .
Think open genome , but we &apos;re going to put little climate re@@ cip@@ es , like Wikipedia , that you can pull down , actu@@ ate and grow .
What does this look like in a world ?
You remember the world connected by str@@ ings ?
We start having be@@ ac@@ ons .
We start sending information about food , rather than sending food .
This is not just my fantas@@ y , this is where we &apos;re already depl@@ o@@ ying .
F@@ ood computers , food ser@@ vers , so@@ on-@@ to-@@ be food data centers , connec@@ ting people together to share information .
The future of food is not about fighting over what &apos;s wrong with this .
We know what &apos;s wrong with this .
The future of food is about net@@ working the next one billion farmers and em@@ power@@ ing them with a platform to ask and answer the question , &quot; What if ? &quot;
Thank you .
There are times when I feel really quite ash@@ amed to be a European .
In the last year , more than a million people arrived in Europe in need of our help , and our response , fran@@ kly , has been p@@ a@@ thetic .
There are just so many contra@@ dictions .
We mour@@ n the trag@@ ic death of two-@@ year-old Al@@ an K@@ ur@@ di , and yet , since then , more than 200 children have sub@@ se@@ qu@@ ently dro@@ w@@ ned in the M@@ ed@@ iter@@ ran@@ e@@ an .
We have international tre@@ ati@@ es that recognize that refuge@@ es are a shared responsibility , and yet we accept that tiny Le@@ ban@@ on ho@@ sts more Sy@@ ri@@ ans than the whole of Europe combin@@ ed .
We lam@@ ent the existence of human s@@ mu@@ ggl@@ ers , and yet we make that the only vi@@ able route to see@@ k as@@ y@@ lu@@ m in Europe .
We have labor shor@@ t@@ ages , and yet we exclu@@ de people who fit our economic and dem@@ ographic needs from coming to Europe .
We pro@@ claim our liber@@ al values in op@@ position to fundament@@ alis@@ t Islam , and yet -- we have repres@@ sive polici@@ es that det@@ ain child as@@ y@@ lu@@ m see@@ kers , that separate children from their families , and that se@@ ize property from refuge@@ es .
What are we doing ?
How has the situation come to this , that we &apos;ve adop@@ ted such an in@@ human@@ e response to a human@@ it@@ arian crisis ?
I don &apos;t believe it &apos;s because people don &apos;t care , or at least I don &apos;t want to believe it &apos;s because people don &apos;t care .
I believe it &apos;s because our politicians lack a vision , a vision for how to adap@@ t an international refuge@@ e system created over 50 years ago for a changing and glob@@ alized world .
And so what I want to do is take a step back and ask two really fundamental questions , the two questions we all need to ask .
First , why is the current system not working ?
And second , what can we do to fix it ?
So the modern refuge@@ e regi@@ me was created in the after@@ math of the Second World War by these guys .
I@@ ts basic ai@@ m is to en@@ sure that when a state fai@@ ls , or worse , turns against its own people , people have somewhere to go , to live in safety and dign@@ ity until they can go home .
It was created precis@@ ely for situations like the situation we see in Sy@@ ri@@ a today .
Th@@ r@@ ough an international con@@ vention signed by 14@@ 7 governments , the 195@@ 1 Con@@ vention on the Stat@@ us of Re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es , and an international organization , U@@ N@@ H@@ C@@ R , states commit@@ ted to reci@@ proc@@ ally ad@@ mit people onto their territ@@ ory who fle@@ e conflict and pers@@ ec@@ ution .
But today , that system is fai@@ ling .
In theory , refuge@@ es have a right to see@@ k as@@ y@@ lu@@ m .
In practice , our im@@ migr@@ ation polici@@ es block the path to safety .
In theory , refuge@@ es have a right to a path@@ way to integr@@ ation , or return to the country they &apos;ve come from .
But in practice , they get stuck in almost in@@ defin@@ ite lim@@ bo .
In theory , refuge@@ es are a shared global responsibility .
In practice , ge@@ ograph@@ y means that countries pro@@ xim@@ ate the conflict take the over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming majority of the world &apos;s refuge@@ es .
The system isn &apos;t broken because the rules are wrong .
It &apos;s that we &apos;re not appl@@ ying them a@@ de@@ qu@@ ately to a changing world , and that &apos;s what we need to re@@ consider .
So I want to explain to you a little bit about how the current system works .
How does the refuge@@ e regi@@ me actually work ?
But not from a top@@ -@@ down institu@@ tional perspective , rather from the perspective of a refuge@@ e .
So imagine a Sy@@ ri@@ an woman .
Let &apos;s call her A@@ mi@@ ra .
And A@@ mi@@ ra to me represents many of the people I &apos;ve met in the region .
A@@ mi@@ ra , like around 25 percent of the world &apos;s refuge@@ es , is a woman with children , and she can &apos;t go home because she comes from this city that you see before you , H@@ oms , a once beautiful and histor@@ ic city now under ru@@ bble .
And so A@@ mi@@ ra can &apos;t go back there .
But A@@ mi@@ ra also has no hope of res@@ et@@ t@@ lement to a third country , because that &apos;s a l@@ ot@@ tery tic@@ ket only available to less than one percent of the world &apos;s refuge@@ es .
So A@@ mi@@ ra and her family face an almost impossible choice .
They have three basic options .
The first option is that A@@ mi@@ ra can take her family to a camp .
In the camp , she might get assistance , but there are very few pro@@ spec@@ ts for A@@ mi@@ ra and her family .
Cam@@ ps are in bl@@ ea@@ k , ari@@ d loc@@ ations , often in the desert .
In the Z@@ a@@ at@@ ar@@ i refuge@@ e camp in J@@ ord@@ an , you can hear the shel@@ ls across the bor@@ der in Sy@@ ri@@ a at ni@@ ght@@ time .
There &apos;s restric@@ ted economic activity .
E@@ ducation is often of poor quality .
And around the world , some 80 percent of refuge@@ es who are in cam@@ ps have to stay for at least five years .
It &apos;s a mis@@ er@@ able existence , and that &apos;s probably why , in reality , only nine percent of Sy@@ ri@@ ans choose that option .
Al@@ tern@@ atively , A@@ mi@@ ra can head to an urban area in a neighbor@@ ing country , like Am@@ man or Be@@ ir@@ ut .
That &apos;s an option that about 75 percent of Sy@@ ri@@ an refuge@@ es have taken .
But there , there &apos;s great difficul@@ ty as well .
Re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es in such urban areas don &apos;t usually have the right to work .
They don &apos;t usually get significant access to assistance .
And so when A@@ mi@@ ra and her family have used up their basic sav@@ ings , they &apos;re left with very little and likely to face urban des@@ ti@@ tu@@ tion .
So there &apos;s a third alternative , and it &apos;s one that increasing numbers of Sy@@ ri@@ ans are taking .
A@@ mi@@ ra can see@@ k some hope for her family by ris@@ king their lives on a dangerous and per@@ il@@ ous journey to another country , and it &apos;s that which we &apos;re seeing in Europe today .
Ar@@ ound the world , we present refuge@@ es with an almost impossible choice between three options : enc@@ am@@ p@@ ment , urban des@@ ti@@ tu@@ tion and dangerous jour@@ ne@@ ys .
For refuge@@ es , that choice is the global refuge@@ e regi@@ me today .
But I think it &apos;s a fal@@ se choice .
I think we can re@@ consider that choice .
The reason why we lim@@ it those options is because we think that those are the only options that are available to refuge@@ es , and they &apos;re not .
Po@@ li@@ tici@@ ans frame the issue as a zer@@ o-@@ sum issue , that if we benefit refuge@@ es , we &apos;re im@@ pos@@ ing costs on citizens .
We tend to have a collective assu@@ mption that refuge@@ es are an in@@ ev@@ itable cost or bur@@ den to society .
But they don &apos;t have to . They can contribu@@ te .
So what I want to argue is there are ways in which we can exp@@ and that choice set and still benefit everyone else : the ho@@ st states and communities , our societies and refuge@@ es themselves .
And I want to suggest four ways we can transform the paradig@@ m of how we think about refuge@@ es .
All four ways have one thing in common : they &apos;re all ways in which we take the opportunities of glob@@ alization , mo@@ bility and markets , and up@@ date the way we think about the refuge@@ e issue .
The first one I want to think about is the idea of en@@ ab@@ ling environments , and it starts from a very basic recogni@@ tion that refuge@@ es are human beings like everyone else , but they &apos;re just in extraordinary circumst@@ ances .
To@@ gether with my colleagues in Oxford , we &apos;ve em@@ bar@@ ked on a research project in U@@ ganda looking at the economic lives of refuge@@ es .
We chose U@@ ganda not because it &apos;s repres@@ ent@@ ative of all ho@@ st countries .
It &apos;s not . It &apos;s excep@@ tional .
Un@@ like most ho@@ st countries around the world , what U@@ ganda has done is give refuge@@ es economic opportunity .
It gives them the right to work . It gives them freedom of movement .
And the results of that are extraordinary both for refuge@@ es and the ho@@ st community .
In the capital city , K@@ am@@ pal@@ a , we found that 21 percent of refuge@@ es own a business that employ@@ s other people , and 40 percent of those employ@@ ees are nation@@ als of the ho@@ st country .
In other words , refuge@@ es are making jobs for citizens of the ho@@ st country .
Even in the cam@@ ps , we found extraordinary examples of vibr@@ ant , fl@@ our@@ ishing and entrepren@@ eu@@ ri@@ al businesses .
For example , in a sett@@ lement called N@@ ak@@ iv@@ ale , we found examples of C@@ ong@@ ol@@ ese refuge@@ es running digital music exchange businesses .
We found a Rw@@ and@@ an who r@@ uns a business that &apos;s available to allow the y@@ ou@@ th to play computer games on recycl@@ ed games con@@ so@@ les and recycl@@ ed telev@@ isions .
A@@ g@@ ainst the od@@ ds of extreme con@@ str@@ aint , refuge@@ es are innov@@ ating , and the gentlem@@ an you see before you is a C@@ ong@@ ol@@ ese guy called D@@ em@@ ou@@ -@@ K@@ ay .
D@@ em@@ ou@@ -@@ K@@ ay arrived in the sett@@ lement with very little , but he wanted to be a fil@@ m@@ ma@@ ker .
So with friends and colleagues , he started a community radio station , he r@@ ented a video camera , and he &apos;s now making films .
He made two document@@ ary films with and for our team , and he &apos;s making a successful business out of very little .
It &apos;s those kinds of examples that should guide our response to refuge@@ es .
R@@ a@@ ther than seeing refuge@@ es as in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably dependent upon human@@ it@@ arian assistance , we need to provide them with opportunities for human fl@@ our@@ ishing .
Yes , clo@@ thes , blan@@ k@@ ets , shel@@ ter , food are all important in the emer@@ gency phase , but we need to also look beyond that .
We need to provide opportunities to connec@@ tivity , electricity , education , the right to work , access to capital and ban@@ king .
All the ways in which we take for gran@@ ted that we are plu@@ gg@@ ed in to the global economy can and should apply to refuge@@ es .
The second idea I want to discus@@ s is economic zones .
Un@@ fortunately , not every ho@@ st country in the world takes the approach U@@ ganda has taken .
Most ho@@ st countries don &apos;t open up their econom@@ ies to refuge@@ es in the same way .
But there are still pr@@ ag@@ mati@@ c alternative options that we can use .
Last A@@ pr@@ il , I trav@@ eled to J@@ ord@@ an with my colle@@ ague , the development econom@@ ist Paul Col@@ lier , and we br@@ ain@@ st@@ orm@@ ed an idea while we were there with the international community and the government , an idea to bring jobs to Sy@@ ri@@ ans while sup@@ porting J@@ ord@@ an &apos;s national development strategy .
The idea is for an economic zone , one in which we could potenti@@ ally integr@@ ate the employ@@ ment of refuge@@ es al@@ ong@@ side the employ@@ ment of J@@ or@@ dan@@ ian ho@@ st nation@@ als .
And just 15 minutes away from the Z@@ a@@ at@@ ar@@ i refuge@@ e camp , home to 8@@ 3,000 refuge@@ es , is an existing economic zone called the King H@@ us@@ sein B@@ in T@@ al@@ al Dev@@ elop@@ ment A@@ re@@ a .
The government has spent over a hundred million dollars connec@@ ting it to the electricity gri@@ d , connec@@ ting it to the road network , but it l@@ acked two things : access to labor and in@@ ward investment .
So what if refuge@@ es were able to work there rather than being stuck in cam@@ ps , able to support their families and develop skills through voc@@ ational training before they go back to Sy@@ ri@@ a ?
We recogni@@ zed that that could benefit J@@ ord@@ an , whose development strategy requires it to make the lea@@ p as a middle income country to manufactu@@ ring .
It could benefit refuge@@ es , but it could also contribu@@ te to the pos@@ t@@ conflict re@@ construction of Sy@@ ri@@ a by recogni@@ zing that we need to in@@ cu@@ b@@ ate refuge@@ es as the best source of eventually re@@ building Sy@@ ri@@ a .
We published the idea in the journal F@@ ore@@ ign A@@ ff@@ airs .
King Ab@@ d@@ ul@@ la@@ h has picked up on the idea .
It was announc@@ ed at the London Sy@@ ri@@ a Con@@ ference two weeks ago , and a pil@@ ot will begin in the summer .
The third idea that I want to put to you is pre@@ ference mat@@ ching between states and refuge@@ es to lead to the kinds of happy out@@ comes you see here in the sel@@ fi@@ e fe@@ atu@@ ring Angel@@ a Mer@@ k@@ el and a Sy@@ ri@@ an refuge@@ e .
What we rar@@ ely do is ask refuge@@ es what they want , where they want to go , but I &apos;d argue we can do that and still make everyone better off .
The econom@@ ist Al@@ vin R@@ oth has developed the idea of mat@@ ching markets , ways in which the pre@@ ference ran@@ king of the parties shapes an even@@ tual match .
My colleagues Will J@@ ones and Ale@@ x T@@ ey@@ tel@@ bo@@ y@@ m have explo@@ red ways in which that idea could be appli@@ ed to refuge@@ es , to ask refuge@@ es to r@@ ank their pre@@ fer@@ red destin@@ ations , but also allow states to r@@ ank the types of refuge@@ es they want on skills cr@@ it@@ eria or language cr@@ it@@ eria and allow those to match .
Now , of course you &apos;d need to build in quot@@ as on things like diversity and vulner@@ ability , but it &apos;s a way of increasing the possibilities of mat@@ ching .
The mat@@ ching idea has been success@@ fully used to match , for instance , students with university places , to match kid@@ ney don@@ ors with patients , and it under@@ lies the kind of algorith@@ ms that exist on d@@ ating web@@ sites .
So why not apply that to give refuge@@ es greater choice ?
It could also be used at the national level , where one of the great challenges we face is to persu@@ ade local communities to accept refuge@@ es .
And at the moment , in my country , for instance , we often send engineers to rural areas and farmers to the cities , which makes no sense at all .
So mat@@ ching markets offer a potential way to bring those pre@@ fer@@ ences together and listen to the needs and dem@@ ands of the populations that ho@@ st and the refuge@@ es themselves .
The fourth idea I want to put to you is of human@@ it@@ arian vis@@ as .
Mu@@ ch of the tr@@ age@@ dy and chaos we &apos;ve seen in Europe was entirely av@@ o@@ id@@ able .
It st@@ ems from a fundamental contra@@ diction in Europe &apos;s as@@ y@@ lu@@ m policy , which is the following : that in order to see@@ k as@@ y@@ lu@@ m in Europe , you have to arrive spon@@ tane@@ ously by em@@ bar@@ king on those dangerous jour@@ ne@@ ys that I described .
But why should those jour@@ ne@@ ys be necessary in an era of the budget air@@ line and modern consul@@ ar cap@@ abilities ?
They &apos;re completely un@@ necessary jour@@ ne@@ ys , and last year , they led to the dea@@ ths of over 3,000 people on Europe &apos;s bor@@ ders and within European territ@@ ory .
If refuge@@ es were simply allowed to travel directly and see@@ k as@@ y@@ lu@@ m in Europe , we would avoid that , and there &apos;s a way of doing that through something called a human@@ it@@ arian vis@@ a , that allows people to collect a vis@@ a at an emb@@ ass@@ y or a consul@@ ate in a neighbor@@ ing country and then simply pay their own way through a fer@@ ry or a flight to Europe .
It costs around a thousand euro@@ s to take a s@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler from Tur@@ key to the Gre@@ ek is@@ lands .
It costs 200 euro@@ s to take a budget air@@ line from Bo@@ dr@@ um to Fr@@ ank@@ fur@@ t .
If we allowed refuge@@ es to do that , it would have major adv@@ antages .
It would save lives , it would under@@ cut the entire market for s@@ mu@@ ggl@@ ers , and it would re@@ move the chaos we see from Europe &apos;s front line in areas like the Gre@@ ek is@@ lands .
It &apos;s politics that prev@@ ents us doing that rather than a rational solution .
And this is an idea that has been appli@@ ed .
Brazil has adop@@ ted a pi@@ on@@ e@@ ering approach where over 2,000 Sy@@ ri@@ ans have been able to get human@@ it@@ arian vis@@ as , enter Brazil , and claim refuge@@ e status on arriv@@ al in Brazil .
And in that s@@ chem@@ e , every Sy@@ ri@@ an who has gone through it has received refuge@@ e status and been recogni@@ zed as a gen@@ u@@ ine refuge@@ e .
There is a histor@@ ical pre@@ ce@@ dent for it as well .
B@@ et@@ ween 19@@ 22 and 194@@ 2 , these N@@ ans@@ en pass@@ ports were used as travel documents to allow 4@@ 5@@ 0,000 As@@ sy@@ ri@@ ans , Tur@@ ks and Ch@@ ech@@ ens to travel across Europe and claim refuge@@ e status el@@ se@@ where in Europe .
And the N@@ ans@@ en International Re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e O@@ ff@@ ice received the Nobel P@@ ea@@ ce Pri@@ ze in recogni@@ tion of this being a vi@@ able strategy .
So all four of these ideas that I &apos;ve pres@@ ented you are ways in which we can exp@@ and A@@ mi@@ ra &apos;s choice set .
They &apos;re ways in which we can have greater choice for refuge@@ es beyond those basic , impossible three options I expl@@ ained to you and still leave others better off .
In conclusion , we really need a new vision , a vision that en@@ larg@@ es the choices of refuge@@ es but recogni@@ zes that they don &apos;t have to be a bur@@ den .
There &apos;s nothing in@@ ev@@ itable about refuge@@ es being a cost .
Yes , they are a human@@ it@@ arian responsibility , but they &apos;re human beings with skills , talents , aspir@@ ations , with the ability to make contribu@@ tions -- if we let them .
In the new world , migr@@ ation is not going to go away .
What we &apos;ve seen in Europe will be with us for many years .
People will continue to travel , they &apos;ll continue to be dis@@ placed , and we need to find rational , re@@ alis@@ tic ways of manag@@ ing this -- not based on the old log@@ ics of human@@ it@@ arian assistance , not based on log@@ ics of char@@ ity , but building on the opportunities off@@ ered by glob@@ alization , markets and mo@@ bility .
I &apos;d ur@@ ge you all to wake up and ur@@ ge our politicians to wake up to this challenge .
Thank you very much .
As a kid , I used to dream about the ocean .
It was this wild place full of color and life , home to these ali@@ en-@@ looking , fantas@@ tical creatures .
I pic@@ tured big shar@@ ks r@@ ul@@ ing the food chain and saw gr@@ ace@@ ful sea tur@@ t@@ les d@@ ancing across coral re@@ efs .
As a marine bio@@ logist turned photograp@@ her , I &apos;ve spent most of my career looking for places as mag@@ ical as those I used to dream about when I was little .
As you can see , I began explor@@ ing bodies of water at a fairly young age .
But the first time I truly went underwater , I was about 10 years old .
And I can still vi@@ vi@@ dly remember fu@@ ri@@ ously fin@@ ning to reach this old , en@@ cru@@ st@@ ed c@@ ann@@ on on a sh@@ allow coral re@@ ef .
And when I finally managed to gra@@ b hold of it , I looked up , and I was inst@@ antly surr@@ ounded by fish in all colors of the rain@@ b@@ ow .
That was the day I fell in love with the ocean .
Thomas P@@ es@@ cha@@ k Con@@ serv@@ ation Ph@@ ot@@ ograp@@ her In my 40 years on this planet , I &apos;ve had the great privil@@ e@@ ge to explore some of its most incredible se@@ as@@ cap@@ es for National Ge@@ ographic Mag@@ az@@ ine and the S@@ ave Our Se@@ as F@@ oundation .
I &apos;ve photograph@@ ed everything from really , really big shar@@ ks to d@@ ain@@ ty ones that fit in the pal@@ m of your hand .
I &apos;ve sm@@ ell@@ ed the fish@@ y , fish@@ y breath of hu@@ mp@@ back wh@@ ales fe@@ eding just feet away from me in the cold se@@ as off Canada &apos;s Great B@@ ear R@@ ain@@ forest .
And I &apos;ve been priv@@ y to the mat@@ ing ritu@@ als of green sea tur@@ t@@ les in the Mo@@ z@@ ambi@@ que Ch@@ an@@ nel .
Every@@ one on this planet aff@@ ects and is affected by the ocean .
And the pr@@ ist@@ ine se@@ as I used to dream of as a child are becoming harder and harder to find .
They are becoming more com@@ pressed and more threat@@ en@@ ed .
As we humans continue to ma@@ intain our role as the leading pre@@ dat@@ or on earth , I &apos;ve wit@@ n@@ essed and photograph@@ ed many of these ri@@ p@@ ple effects fir@@ s@@ th@@ and .
For a long time , I thought I had to shoc@@ k my audience out of their in@@ difference with dis@@ tur@@ bing images .
And while this approach has mer@@ its , I have come full circle .
I believe that the best way for me to effect change is to sell love .
I guess I &apos;m a mat@@ ch@@ ma@@ ker of sorts and as a photograp@@ her , I have the rare opportunity to reve@@ al animals and entire eco@@ systems that lie hidden bene@@ ath the ocean &apos;s surface .
You can &apos;t love something and become a champi@@ on for it if you don &apos;t know it exists .
Un@@ co@@ vering this -- that is the power of conservation photograph@@ y .
I &apos;ve vis@@ ited hundreds of marine loc@@ ations , but there are a hand@@ ful of se@@ as@@ cap@@ es that have tou@@ ched me incredibly deeply .
The first time I experienced that kind of high was about 10 years ago , off South Africa &apos;s ru@@ gg@@ ed , wild coast .
And every J@@ une and Ju@@ ly , enormous sho@@ als of s@@ ar@@ din@@ es travel nor@@ th@@ wards in a mass migr@@ ation we call the S@@ ard@@ ine R@@ un .
And boy , do those fish have good reason to run .
In hot pur@@ suit are ho@@ ards of hun@@ gry and ag@@ ile pre@@ dat@@ ors .
Com@@ mon dol@@ phins hun@@ t together and they can separate some of the s@@ ar@@ din@@ es from the main sho@@ al and they create b@@ ait b@@ alls .
They drive and tra@@ p the fish up@@ ward against the ocean surface and then they r@@ ush in to d@@ ine on this pul@@ s@@ ating and mo@@ v@@ able fe@@ ast .
C@@ lose behind are shar@@ ks .
Now , most people believe that shar@@ ks and dol@@ phins are these mor@@ tal enem@@ ies , but during the S@@ ard@@ ine R@@ un , they actually co@@ exist .
In fact , dol@@ phins actually help shar@@ ks feed more effectively .
Wi@@ th@@ out dol@@ phins , the b@@ ait b@@ alls are more dis@@ pers@@ ed and shar@@ ks often end up with what I call a s@@ ard@@ ine don@@ ut , or a mouth full of water .
Now , while I &apos;ve had a few sp@@ ic@@ y moments with shar@@ ks on the s@@ ard@@ ine run , I know they don &apos;t see me as pre@@ y .
However , I get bu@@ mp@@ ed and t@@ ail@@ -@@ sl@@ apped just like any other gu@@ est at this ro@@ w@@ dy , ro@@ w@@ dy ban@@ qu@@ et .
From the shor@@ es of Africa we travel e@@ ast , across the vas@@ t@@ ness that is the Indian O@@ ce@@ an to the Mal@@ di@@ ves , an archi@@ pel@@ ago of coral is@@ lands .
And during the stor@@ my sou@@ th@@ west mon@@ soon , man@@ ta r@@ ays from all across the archi@@ pel@@ ago travel to a tiny spec@@ k in B@@ a@@ a At@@ ol@@ l called H@@ ani@@ far@@ u .
Ar@@ mi@@ es of cru@@ st@@ ace@@ ans , most no bigger than the size of your pu@@ p@@ ils , are the main@@ stay of the man@@ ta ray &apos;s di@@ et .
When plan@@ k@@ ton concentr@@ ations become pat@@ ch@@ y , man@@ ta r@@ ays feed alone and they som@@ er@@ sau@@ lt themselves back@@ wards again and again , very much like a pu@@ pp@@ y ch@@ as@@ ing its own tail .
However , when plan@@ k@@ ton den@@ si@@ ties increase , the man@@ t@@ as line up hea@@ d-@@ to-@@ tail to form these long fe@@ eding ch@@ ains , and any tas@@ ty mor@@ sel that es@@ cap@@ es the first or second man@@ ta in line is su@@ rely to be go@@ b@@ bl@@ ed up by the next or the one after .
As plan@@ k@@ ton levels pea@@ k in the b@@ ay , the man@@ t@@ as swi@@ m closer and closer together in a unique behavior we call cy@@ cl@@ one fe@@ eding .
And as they sw@@ ir@@ l in ti@@ ght formation , this multi-@@ step col@@ um@@ n of man@@ t@@ as creates its own v@@ or@@ te@@ x , suc@@ king in and deli@@ vering the plan@@ k@@ ton right into the man@@ t@@ as &apos; c@@ aver@@ n@@ ous mou@@ ths .
The experience of di@@ ving am@@ ong@@ st such mas@@ ses of hundreds of r@@ ays is truly un@@ for@@ get@@ table .
When I first photograph@@ ed H@@ ani@@ far@@ u , the site enjo@@ yed no protection and was threat@@ en@@ ed by development .
And working with N@@ G@@ O@@ s like the M@@ anta Tr@@ ust , my images eventually helped H@@ ani@@ far@@ u become a mar@@ in@@ e-@@ protected area .
Now , fish@@ er@@ man from neighbor@@ ing is@@ lands , they once hun@@ ted these man@@ ta r@@ ays to make traditional dru@@ ms from their sk@@ ins .
Today , they are the most ar@@ dent conservation champi@@ ons and man@@ ta r@@ ays ear@@ n the Mal@@ divi@@ an economy in exc@@ ess of 8 million dollars every single year .
I have always wanted to travel back in time to an era where maps were mostly bl@@ ank or they read , &quot; There be drag@@ ons . &quot;
And today , the clo@@ s@@ est I &apos;ve come is vis@@ iting remote at@@ ol@@ ls in the w@@ estern Indian O@@ ce@@ an .
F@@ ar , far away from shi@@ pping lan@@ es and fishing fle@@ ets , di@@ ving into these wat@@ ers is a poign@@ ant re@@ min@@ der of what our oceans once looked like .
Very few people have heard of B@@ ass@@ as da India , a tiny spec@@ k of coral in the Mo@@ z@@ ambi@@ que Ch@@ an@@ nel .
I@@ ts re@@ ef forms a prot@@ ective ou@@ ter barri@@ er and the inner l@@ ag@@ o@@ on is a nur@@ ser@@ y ground for Gal@@ ap@@ ag@@ os shar@@ ks .
These shar@@ ks are anything but sh@@ y , even during the day .
I had a bit of a hun@@ ch that they &apos;d be even b@@ older and more ab@@ un@@ dant at night .
N@@ ever before have I en@@ coun@@ tered so many shar@@ ks on a single coral out@@ cro@@ p .
Cap@@ tur@@ ing and sharing moments like this -- that re@@ minds me why I chose my path .
Ear@@ lier this year , I was on as@@ sign@@ ment for National Ge@@ ographic Mag@@ az@@ ine in B@@ aj@@ a California .
And about hal@@ f@@ way down the pen@@ in@@ su@@ la on the Paci@@ fic side lies San I@@ gn@@ aci@@ o L@@ ag@@ o@@ on , a critical cal@@ ving ground for gr@@ ay wh@@ ales .
For 100 years , this coast was the scene of a wh@@ ol@@ es@@ ale s@@ lau@@ ghter , where more than 20@@ ,000 gr@@ ay wh@@ ales were killed , leaving only a few hundred surviv@@ ors .
Today the descend@@ ents of these same wh@@ ales nu@@ dge their youn@@ g@@ sters to the surface to play and even interact with us .
This species truly has made a remarkable com@@ e@@ back .
Now , on the other side of the pen@@ in@@ su@@ la lies C@@ ab@@ o P@@ ul@@ m@@ o , a sle@@ ep@@ y fishing village .
D@@ ec@@ ades of over@@ fishing had brought them close to collap@@ se .
In 199@@ 5 , local fish@@ er@@ man convinced the auth@@ ori@@ ties to pro@@ claim their wat@@ ers a marine res@@ erve .
But what happened next was nothing short of mirac@@ ul@@ ous .
In 2005 , after only a single decade of protection , scientists measu@@ red the largest reco@@ very of fish ever recor@@ ded .
But don &apos;t take my word for it -- come with me .
On a single breath , swi@@ m with me in deep , into one of the largest and den@@ s@@ est schools of fish I have ever en@@ coun@@ tered .
We all have the ability to be cre@@ ators of hope .
And through my photograph@@ y , I want to pass on the message that it is not too late for our oceans .
And particularly , I want to focus on nature &apos;s res@@ ili@@ ence in the face of 7@@ .@@ 3 billion people .
My hope is that in the future , I will have to search much , much harder to make photograph@@ s like this , while creating images that sho@@ w@@ case our resp@@ ect@@ ful co@@ existence with the ocean .
Those will hopefully become an everyday oc@@ curr@@ ence for me .
To th@@ ri@@ ve and survive in my prof@@ ession , you really have to be a hop@@ eless optimis@@ t .
And I always operate on the assu@@ mption that the next great picture that will effect change is right around the corner , behind the next coral head , inside the next l@@ ag@@ o@@ on or possibly , in the one after it .
When I moved to Har@@ are in 198@@ 5 , social justice was at the core of Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we &apos;s national health policy .
The new government emerg@@ ed from a long war of in@@ depend@@ ence and immediately pro@@ cl@@ aim@@ ed a soci@@ alis@@ t ag@@ end@@ a : health care services , prim@@ ary education became essentially free .
A massive expansion of rural health centers placed roughly 80 percent of the population less than a two-@@ hour walk from these fac@@ ilities , a truly remarkable accompl@@ ish@@ ment .
In 1980 , the year of in@@ depend@@ ence , 25 percent of Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we@@ an children were fully imm@@ uni@@ zed .
By 1990 , a m@@ ere decade later , this propor@@ tion stood at 80 percent .
I felt tremend@@ ously privil@@ eg@@ ed to be part of this transformation , a revolution .
The excit@@ ement , the cam@@ ar@@ ad@@ erie , was pal@@ p@@ able .
Wor@@ king side by side with brilliant Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we@@ ans -- scientists , doctors , activis@@ ts -- I felt connected not only to an African in@@ depend@@ ence movement , but to a global progr@@ essive public health movement .
But there were dau@@ n@@ ting challenges .
Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we re@@ ported its first AIDS case in 198@@ 5 , the year I arrived .
I had taken care of a few patients with AIDS in the early 198@@ 0s , when I did my medical training at Har@@ lem Ho@@ sp@@ ital , but -- we had no idea what lay in store for Africa .
In@@ f@@ ection rate stood at about two percent in my early days there .
These would so@@ ar to one out of every four adults by the time I left Har@@ are 17 years later .
By the mi@@ d-@@ 199@@ 0s , I &apos;d told hundreds of people in the prime of life that they were HI@@ V@@ -@@ positive .
I saw colleagues and friends die , my students , hospital patients , die .
In response , my colleagues and I set up a clin@@ ic .
We did con@@ dom demonstr@@ ations .
We launched school education and work@@ place inter@@ venti@@ ons .
We did research . We coun@@ sel@@ ed the part@@ ners of inf@@ ected men about how to protect themselves .
We worked hard , and at the time , I believed that I was doing my best .
I was provi@@ ding ex@@ cellent treatment , such as it was .
But I was not talking about struc@@ tural change .
For@@ mer U@@ N Sec@@ ret@@ ary K@@ of@@ i An@@ n@@ an has spo@@ ken candi@@ dly about his personal failure leading to the Rw@@ and@@ an gen@@ o@@ cide .
In 199@@ 4 , he was head of the U@@ N pe@@ ace@@ keeping de@@ partment .
At a 10@@ -@@ year mem@@ ori@@ al for the gen@@ o@@ cide , he refl@@ ected , &quot; I believed at the time I was doing my best , but I realized after the gen@@ o@@ cide that there was more I could and should have done to sound the al@@ arm and r@@ ally support . &quot;
The AIDS epidemic caught the health community un@@ prepar@@ ed , and today , when the World Health Or@@ gan@@ ization esti@@ mates that 3@@ 9 million people have lost their lives to this disease , I &apos;m not alone in feeling re@@ mor@@ se and regre@@ t at not having done more earlier .
But while living in Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we , I didn &apos;t see my role as an ad@@ voc@@ acy or a political one .
I was there for my technical skills , both my clinical and my research epidem@@ i@@ ology skills .
And in my mind , my job was to take care of patients and to do research to better understand the population patterns of transmission , and I hop@@ ed that we &apos;d slow the spread of the virus .
I was aware that soci@@ ally mar@@ gin@@ alized populations were at dis@@ propor@@ tion@@ ate risk of getting and dying of AIDS .
And on the su@@ gar plan@@ tations , which really more clo@@ sely res@@ embl@@ ed feu@@ d@@ al fi@@ e@@ f@@ dom@@ s than any modern enter@@ prise , 60 percent of pregn@@ ant women tes@@ ted HI@@ V@@ -@@ positive .
I worked to show how getting inf@@ ected was not a moral failure but instead related to a culture of male super@@ i@@ ority , to forced migr@@ ant labor and to colon@@ i@@ alism .
Wh@@ ites were larg@@ ely un@@ sc@@ ath@@ ed .
As health professi@@ on@@ als , our tools were pi@@ ti@@ fully wea@@ k : impl@@ or@@ ing people to change their individual behavi@@ ors , use con@@ dom@@ s , reduce number of part@@ ners .
In@@ f@@ ection rates clim@@ bed , and when treatment became available in the West , treatment that re@@ mains our most po@@ tent wea@@ pon against this virus , it was un@@ aff@@ ord@@ able to the public sector across Africa .
I didn &apos;t speak out about the un@@ equal access to these life@@ -@@ saving drugs or about the under@@ lying economic and political systems that were driving infection rates in such huge sw@@ ath@@ s of the population .
I r@@ ation@@ alized my silence by re@@ min@@ ding myself that I was a gu@@ est in the country , that sou@@ n@@ ding the al@@ arm could even get me k@@ ic@@ ked out , keep me from doing good work , taking care of my patients , doing mu@@ ch@@ -@@ needed research .
So I didn &apos;t speak out about the government &apos;s early st@@ ance on AIDS .
I didn &apos;t voice my concer@@ ns lou@@ dly enough .
Many doctors , health professi@@ on@@ als , may think I did nothing wrong .
Our p@@ act with our patients , the H@@ i@@ p@@ po@@ cratic O@@ ath and its vari@@ ants , is about the s@@ anc@@ ti@@ ty of the pati@@ ent-@@ doctor relationship .
And I did everything I could for each and every patient of mine .
But I knew that epidem@@ ics emer@@ ge along the f@@ issu@@ res of our society , refl@@ ecting not only biology , but more importantly patterns of mar@@ gin@@ alization , exclu@@ sion , discrimin@@ ation related to race , gender , sexu@@ ality , class and more .
It was true of AIDS .
It was true just recently of Ebola .
Medic@@ al anthropo@@ logists such as Paul F@@ ar@@ mer , who worked on AIDS in Hai@@ ti , call this struc@@ tural violence : struc@@ tural because ine@@ qui@@ ties are em@@ bed@@ ded in the political and economic organization of our social world , often in ways that are invisible to those with privil@@ e@@ ge and power ; and violence because its impact -- pre@@ m@@ ature dea@@ ths , suffering , ill@@ ness -- is violent .
We do little for our patients if we fail to recognize these social in@@ justi@@ ces .
S@@ oun@@ ding the al@@ arm is the first step towards doing public health right , and it &apos;s how we may r@@ ally support to break through and create real change together .
So these days , I &apos;m not st@@ aying qui@@ et .
I &apos;m speaking up about a lot of things , even when it makes listen@@ ers un@@ comfortable , even when it makes me un@@ comfortable .
And a lot of this is about rac@@ ial dispar@@ i@@ ties and institu@@ tion@@ alized rac@@ ism , things that we &apos;re not supposed to have in this country anymore , certainly not in the practice of medicine or public health .
But we have them , and we pay for them in lives cut short .
That &apos;s why sou@@ n@@ ding the al@@ arm about the impact of rac@@ ism on health in the United States , the on@@ going institu@@ tional and inter@@ personal violence that people of color face , com@@ pou@@ n@@ ded by our trag@@ ic leg@@ acy of 250 years of sl@@ av@@ ery , 90 years of Jim C@@ row and 60 years of im@@ perfect equality , sou@@ n@@ ding the al@@ arm about this is central to doing my job right as New York City &apos;s Health Com@@ mis@@ sion@@ er .
In New York City , pre@@ m@@ ature mortality -- that &apos;s death before the age of 65 -- is 50 percent higher for black men than white ones .
A black woman in 2012 fac@@ ed more than 10 times the risk of dying related to child@@ birth as a white woman .
And though we &apos;ve made enormous str@@ ides in re@@ duc@@ ing inf@@ ant mortality rates , a black baby still faces nearly three times the risk of death in its first year of life as compared to a white baby .
New York City &apos;s not excep@@ tional .
These statistics are parall@@ eled by statistics found across the United States .
A recent New York Times analysis re@@ ported that there are 1.@@ 5 million missing black men across the country .
They not@@ ed that more than one out of every six black men who today should be between the ages of 25 and 5@@ 4 years have dis@@ appeared from daily life , lost either to prison or pre@@ m@@ ature death .
There is great in@@ justice in the daily and dis@@ propor@@ tion@@ ate violence fac@@ ed by young black men , the focus of recent prot@@ ests under the b@@ ann@@ er # Bl@@ ack@@ L@@ iv@@ es@@ Mat@@ ter .
But we have to remember that end@@ ur@@ ing and dispar@@ ate rates and the oc@@ curr@@ ence and out@@ come of common medical conditions -- heart disease , cancer , diab@@ et@@ es , HIV -- diseases that may kill slowly and qui@@ et@@ ly and take even more black lives pre@@ m@@ atu@@ rely .
As the # Bl@@ ack@@ L@@ iv@@ es@@ Mat@@ ter movement un@@ fol@@ ded , I felt frustr@@ ated and an@@ gry that the medical community has been re@@ lu@@ c@@ tant to even use the word &quot; rac@@ ism &quot; in our research and our work .
You &apos;ve probably felt something every time I &apos;ve said it .
Our medical students held di@@ e-@@ ins in their white co@@ ats , but the medical community has larg@@ ely stood by pas@@ sively as on@@ going discrimin@@ ation contin@@ ues to affect the disease pro@@ file and mortality .
And I worry that the tr@@ end towards person@@ alized and precis@@ ion medicine , looking for biological or genetic tar@@ gets to better t@@ ai@@ lo@@ r treatment , may in@@ adver@@ t@@ ently cause us to lose sight of the big picture , that it is the daily context , where a person lives , gro@@ ws , works , lo@@ ves , that most importantly determin@@ es population health , and for too many of us , poor health .
As health professi@@ on@@ als in our daily work , whether in the clin@@ ic or doing research , we are wit@@ ness to great in@@ justice : the hom@@ eless person who is un@@ able to follow medical ad@@ vice because he has more pr@@ essing pri@@ ori@@ ties ; the trans@@ gender y@@ ou@@ th who is cont@@ empl@@ ating suicide because our society is just so har@@ s@@ h ; the single mother who has been made to feel that she is responsible for the poor health of her child .
Our role as health professi@@ on@@ als is not just to treat our patients but to sound the al@@ arm and ad@@ voc@@ ate for change .
Ri@@ ght@@ fully or not , our soci@@ et@@ al position gives our voices great cre@@ di@@ bility , and we shouldn &apos;t waste that .
I regre@@ t not speaking up in Z@@ im@@ bab@@ we , and I &apos;ve prom@@ is@@ ed myself that as New York City &apos;s Health Com@@ mis@@ sion@@ er , I will use every opportunity I have to sound the al@@ arm and r@@ ally support for health equ@@ ity .
I will speak out against rac@@ ism , and I hope you will join me , and I will join you when you speak out against sex@@ ism or any other form of inequality .
It &apos;s time for us to rise up and collec@@ tively speak up about struc@@ tural inequality .
We don &apos;t have to have all the answers to call for change .
We just need courage .
The health of our patients , the health of us all , depends on it .
All right , I want to see a show of hands : how many of you have un@@ fri@@ ended someone on Facebook because they said something off@@ en@@ sive about politics or religion , child@@ care , food ?
And how many of you know at least one person that you avoid because you just don &apos;t want to talk to them ?
You know , it used to be that in order to have a pol@@ ite conversation , we just had to follow the ad@@ vice of Hen@@ ry H@@ ig@@ g@@ ins in &quot; My F@@ air Lad@@ y &quot; : S@@ tic@@ k to the weather and your health .
But these days , with climate change and anti-@@ v@@ ax@@ x@@ ing , those subj@@ ects -- are not safe either .
So this world that we live in , this world in which every conversation has the potential to dev@@ ol@@ ve into an argument , where our politicians can &apos;t speak to one another and where even the most tri@@ vi@@ al of issues have someone fighting both pas@@ sion@@ ately for it and against it , it &apos;s not normal .
P@@ ew Res@@ ear@@ ch did a study of 10,000 American adults , and they found that at this moment , we are more pol@@ ar@@ ized , we are more divi@@ ded , than we ever have been in history .
We &apos;re less likely to com@@ promise , which means we &apos;re not listening to each other .
And we make decisions about where to live , who to mar@@ ry and even who our friends are going to be , based on what we already believe .
Again , that means we &apos;re not listening to each other .
A conversation requires a balance between talking and listening , and somewhere along the way , we lost that balance .
Now , part of that is due to technology .
The smart@@ phones that you all either have in your hands or close enough that you could gra@@ b them really quickly .
Ac@@ cor@@ ding to P@@ ew Res@@ ear@@ ch , about a third of American teen@@ agers send more than a hundred tex@@ ts a day .
And many of them , almost most of them , are more likely to text their friends than they are to talk to them face to face .
There &apos;s this great piece in The Atlan@@ tic .
It was written by a high school teacher named Paul Bar@@ n@@ well .
And he gave his kids a communication project .
He wanted to teach them how to speak on a specific subject without using notes .
And he said this : &quot; I came to realize ... &quot;
&quot; I came to realize that convers@@ ational comp@@ et@@ ence might be the single most over@@ looked sk@@ ill we fail to teach .
K@@ ids spend hours each day engag@@ ing with ideas and each other through scre@@ ens , but rar@@ ely do they have an opportunity to h@@ one their inter@@ personal communications skills .
It might sound like a funny question , but we have to ask ourselves : Is there any 21@@ st-@@ century sk@@ ill more important than being able to sust@@ ain co@@ her@@ ent , confi@@ dent conversation ? &quot;
Now , I make my living talking to people : Nobel Pri@@ ze win@@ ners , truc@@ k dri@@ vers , billi@@ on@@ aires , kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten teachers , heads of state , plu@@ m@@ bers .
I talk to people that I like . I talk to people that I don &apos;t like .
I talk to some people that I dis@@ agree with deeply on a personal level .
But I still have a great conversation with them .
So I &apos;d like to spend the next 10 minutes or so teaching you how to talk and how to listen .
Many of you have already heard a lot of ad@@ vice on this , things like look the person in the eye , think of interesting top@@ ics to discus@@ s in adv@@ ance , look , no@@ d and s@@ mile to show that you &apos;re paying attention , repe@@ at back what you just heard or sum@@ mar@@ ize it .
So I want you to forget all of that .
It is cr@@ ap .
There is no reason to learn how to show you &apos;re paying attention if you are in fact paying attention .
Now , I actually use the exact same skills as a professional intervie@@ wer that I do in regular life .
So , I &apos;m going to teach you how to interview people , and that &apos;s actually going to help you learn how to be better convers@@ ation@@ alis@@ ts .
L@@ ear@@ n to have a conversation without was@@ ting your time , without getting bo@@ red , and , please God , without off@@ ending anybody .
We &apos;ve all had really great conversations .
We &apos;ve had them before . We know what it &apos;s like .
The kind of conversation where you walk away feeling engaged and inspired , or where you feel like you &apos;ve made a real connection or you &apos;ve been perfectly understood .
There is no reason why most of your interactions can &apos;t be like that .
So I have 10 basic rules . I &apos;m going to walk you through all of them , but hon@@ est@@ ly , if you just choose one of them and master it , you &apos;ll already enjoy better conversations .
Num@@ ber one : Don &apos;t mul@@ tit@@ ask .
And I don &apos;t mean just set down your cell phone or your tab@@ let or your car keys or whatever is in your hand .
I mean , be present .
B@@ e in that moment .
Don &apos;t think about your argument you had with your bo@@ ss .
Don &apos;t think about what you &apos;re going to have for dinner .
If you want to get out of the conversation , get out of the conversation , but don &apos;t be half in it and half out of it .
Num@@ ber two : Don &apos;t pon@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate .
If you want to state your opinion without any opportunity for response or argument or push@@ back or growth , write a blog .
Now , there &apos;s a really good reason why I don &apos;t allow pun@@ d@@ its on my show : Because they &apos;re really bor@@ ing .
If they &apos;re conserv@@ ative , they &apos;re going to hate Obama and food st@@ am@@ ps and abor@@ tion .
If they &apos;re liber@@ al , they &apos;re going to hate big ban@@ ks and oil corpor@@ ations and D@@ ick Ch@@ en@@ ey .
T@@ ot@@ ally predic@@ table .
And you don &apos;t want to be like that .
You need to enter every conversation as@@ sum@@ ing that you have something to learn .
The fam@@ ed therap@@ ist M. Scot@@ t P@@ ec@@ k said that true listening requires a setting as@@ ide of on@@ es@@ el@@ f .
And sometimes that means setting as@@ ide your personal opinion .
He said that sen@@ sing this accep@@ t@@ ance , the spea@@ ker will become less and less vulnerable and more and more likely to open up the inner rec@@ esses of his or her mind to the listen@@ er .
Again , assu@@ me that you have something to learn .
Bill N@@ y@@ e : &quot; Every@@ one you will ever meet knows something that you don &apos;t . &quot;
I put it this way : Everybody is an expert in something .
Num@@ ber three : U@@ se open-@@ ended questions .
In this case , take a cue from journalis@@ ts .
St@@ art your questions with who , what , when , where , why or how .
If you put in a complicated question , you &apos;re going to get a simple answer out .
If I ask you , &quot; W@@ ere you terri@@ fied ? &quot;
you &apos;re going to respond to the most powerful word in that sentence , which is &quot; terri@@ fied , &quot; and the answer is &quot; Yes , I was &quot; or &quot; No , I wasn &apos;t . &quot;
&quot; W@@ ere you an@@ gry ? &quot; &quot; Yes , I was very an@@ gry . &quot;
Let them describe it . They &apos;re the ones that know .
Tr@@ y asking them things like , &quot; What was that like ? &quot;
&quot; How did that feel ? &quot;
Because then they might have to stop for a moment and think about it , and you &apos;re going to get a much more interesting response .
Num@@ ber four : Go with the flow .
That means thoughts will come into your mind and you need to let them go out of your mind .
We &apos;ve heard intervie@@ ws often in which a gu@@ est is talking for several minutes and then the ho@@ st comes back in and asks a question which seems like it comes out of no@@ where , or it &apos;s already been ans@@ wer@@ ed .
That means the ho@@ st probably stopped listening two minutes ago because he thought of this really cl@@ ever question , and he was just b@@ ound and determin@@ ed to say that .
And we do the exact same thing .
We &apos;re sitting there having a conversation with someone , and then we remember that time that we met Hu@@ gh J@@ ack@@ man in a coffee shop .
And we stop listening .
St@@ ories and ideas are going to come to you .
You need to let them come and let them go .
Num@@ ber five : If you don &apos;t know , say that you don &apos;t know .
Now , people on the radio , especially on N@@ P@@ R , are much more aware that they &apos;re going on the record , and so they &apos;re more care@@ ful about what they claim to be an expert in and what they claim to know for sure .
Do that . E@@ r@@ r on the side of cau@@ tion .
Talk should not be cheap .
Num@@ ber six : Don &apos;t equ@@ ate your experience with the@@ irs .
If they &apos;re talking about having lost a family member , don &apos;t start talking about the time you lost a family member .
If they &apos;re talking about the trouble they &apos;re having at work , don &apos;t tell them about how much you hate your job .
It &apos;s not the same . It is never the same .
All experiences are individual .
And , more importantly , it is not about you .
You don &apos;t need to take that moment to prove how amazing you are or how much you &apos;ve suff@@ ered .
Some@@ body asked Steph@@ en Haw@@ king once what his I@@ Q was , and he said , &quot; I have no idea . People who br@@ ag about their I@@ Q@@ s are lo@@ s@@ ers . &quot;
Con@@ vers@@ ations are not a prom@@ o@@ tional opportunity .
Num@@ ber seven : Tr@@ y not to repe@@ at yourself .
It &apos;s con@@ desc@@ ending , and it &apos;s really bor@@ ing , and we tend to do it a lot .
E@@ speci@@ ally in work conversations or in conversations with our kids , we have a point to make , so we just keep re@@ ph@@ r@@ as@@ ing it over and over .
Don &apos;t do that .
Num@@ ber eight : St@@ ay out of the wee@@ ds .
Fr@@ ank@@ ly , people don &apos;t care about the years , the names , the dat@@ es , all those details that you &apos;re stru@@ ggl@@ ing to come up with in your mind .
They don &apos;t care . What they care about is you .
They care about what you &apos;re like , what you have in common .
So forget the details . Le@@ ave them out .
Num@@ ber nine : This is not the last one , but it is the most important one .
L@@ isten .
I cannot tell you how many really important people have said that listening is perhaps the most , the number one most important sk@@ ill that you could develop .
Bu@@ dd@@ ha said , and I &apos;m par@@ aph@@ r@@ as@@ ing , &quot; If your mouth is open , you &apos;re not learning . &quot;
And Cal@@ vin C@@ oo@@ li@@ dge said , &quot; No man ever listen@@ ed his way out of a job . &quot;
Why do we not listen to each other ?
Num@@ ber one , we &apos;d rather talk .
When I &apos;m talking , I &apos;m in control .
I don &apos;t have to hear anything I &apos;m not interested in .
I &apos;m the center of attention .
I can b@@ ol@@ ster my own identity .
But there &apos;s another reason : We get dis@@ trac@@ ted .
The average person talks at about 2@@ 25 word per minute , but we can listen at up to 500 words per minute .
So our minds are f@@ illing in those other 2@@ 75 words .
And look , I know , it takes effort and energy to actually pay attention to someone , but if you can &apos;t do that , you &apos;re not in a conversation .
You &apos;re just two people sh@@ ou@@ ting out bar@@ ely related sent@@ ences in the same place .
You have to listen to one another .
Steph@@ en Co@@ vey said it very beauti@@ fully .
He said , &quot; Most of us don &apos;t listen with the int@@ ent to understand .
We listen with the int@@ ent to re@@ ply . &quot;
One more rule , number 10 , and it &apos;s this one : B@@ e bri@@ ef .
&#91; A good conversation is like a min@@ is@@ k@@ ir@@ t ; short enough to ret@@ ain interest , but long enough to cover the subject . -- My S@@ ister &#93; All of this bo@@ ils down to the same basic concept , and it is this one : B@@ e interested in other people .
You know , I grew up with a very famous grand@@ father , and there was kind of a ritu@@ al in my home .
People would come over to talk to my grand@@ parents , and after they would leave , my mother would come over to us , and she &apos;d say , &quot; Do you know who that was ?
She was the run@@ ner@@ -up to M@@ is@@ s America .
He was the may@@ or of S@@ ac@@ ramen@@ to .
She won a P@@ ul@@ it@@ z@@ er Pri@@ ze . He &apos;s a Rus@@ sian ball@@ et d@@ ancer . &quot;
And I kind of grew up as@@ sum@@ ing everyone has some hidden , amazing thing about them .
And hon@@ est@@ ly , I think it &apos;s what makes me a better ho@@ st .
I keep my mouth sh@@ ut as often as I possibly can , I keep my mind open , and I &apos;m always prepar@@ ed to be amaz@@ ed , and I &apos;m never dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted .
You do the same thing .
Go out , talk to people , listen to people , and , most importantly , be prepar@@ ed to be amaz@@ ed .
Thanks .
H@@ ell@@ o .
My name is Mat@@ the@@ w Willi@@ ams , and I am a champi@@ on .
I have won me@@ d@@ als in three different sports and national games in Canada , comp@@ eted at the international level in bas@@ ket@@ ball and was proud to represent Canada on the world stage .
I train five days a week for bas@@ ket@@ ball and speed sk@@ ating , work with top quality co@@ aches and mental performance consul@@ t@@ ants to be at my best in my sport .
By the way , all that is through Sp@@ ec@@ ial O@@ lym@@ pic@@ s .
Does that change the way you think of me and my accompl@@ ish@@ ments ?
The world does not see all people like me as champi@@ ons .
Not long ago , people like me were sh@@ un@@ ned and hidden away .
There has been lots of change since Sp@@ ec@@ ial O@@ lym@@ pic@@ s began in 196@@ 8 , but in too many cases , people with intellectu@@ al dis@@ abilities are invisible to the wi@@ der population .
People use the r@@ -@@ word in front of me , and they think it doesn &apos;t matter .
That &apos;s the word &quot; re@@ t@@ ard &quot; or &quot; ret@@ ar@@ ded &quot; used in a der@@ o@@ g@@ atory man@@ ner .
They &apos;re not thinking about how much it hur@@ ts me and my friends .
I don &apos;t want you to think I &apos;m here because I &apos;m a char@@ ity case .
I am here because there is still a big problem with the way many people see individuals with intellectu@@ al dis@@ abilities , or , too often , how they don &apos;t see them at all .
Did you know the World G@@ ames happened this year ?
I was one of over 6@@ ,@@ 500 ath@@ let@@ es with intellectu@@ al dis@@ abilities from 1@@ 65 countries who comp@@ eted in LA .
There was over 6@@ 2,000 spec@@ tat@@ ors watching opening cer@@ em@@ on@@ ies , and there was live co@@ ver@@ age on T@@ S@@ N and E@@ S@@ P@@ N .
Did you even know that happened ?
What do you think of when you see someone like me ?
I am here today to challenge you to look at us as equ@@ als .
Sp@@ ec@@ ial O@@ lym@@ pic@@ s transform@@ s the self-@@ identity of ath@@ let@@ es with intellectu@@ al dis@@ abilities and the per@@ cep@@ tions of everyone watching .
For those of you who aren &apos;t familiar , Sp@@ ec@@ ial O@@ lym@@ pic@@ s is for ath@@ let@@ es with intellectu@@ al dis@@ abilities .
Sp@@ ec@@ ial O@@ lym@@ pic@@ s is separate from the Par@@ aly@@ m@@ pic@@ s and O@@ lym@@ pic@@ s .
We offer high-@@ quality , year round sports programs for people with intellectu@@ al dis@@ abilities that changes lives and per@@ cep@@ tions .
This movement has changed my life and those of so many others .
And it has changed the way the world sees people with intellectu@@ al dis@@ abilities .
I was born with e@@ pil@@ ep@@ s@@ y and an intellectu@@ al dis@@ ability .
Gro@@ wing up , I played h@@ oc@@ key until I was 12 years old .
The older I got , the more I felt it was harder to keep up with everyone else , and I was an@@ gry and frustr@@ ated .
For a while , I did not play any sports , didn &apos;t have many friends and felt left out and sad .
There was a time when people with intellectu@@ al dis@@ abilities were hidden away from society .
No one thought they could particip@@ ate in sports , let alone be a valu@@ ed member of society .
In the 196@@ 0s , Dr. Frank H@@ ay@@ den , a scientist at the University of Tor@@ onto , was studying the effects of regular exercise on the f@@ it@@ ness levels of children with intellectu@@ al dis@@ abilities .
U@@ sing ri@@ gor@@ ous scientific research , Dr. H@@ ay@@ den and other researchers came to the conclusion that it was simply the lack of opportunity to particip@@ ate that caused their f@@ it@@ ness levels to suff@@ er .
L@@ ots of people doub@@ ted that people with intellectu@@ al dis@@ abilities could benefit from f@@ it@@ ness programs and sports competition opportunities .
But pi@@ on@@ e@@ ers like Dr. H@@ ay@@ den and E@@ uni@@ ce Ken@@ ne@@ dy Sh@@ river , the f@@ oun@@ der of Sp@@ ec@@ ial O@@ lym@@ pic@@ s , pers@@ ever@@ ed , and Sp@@ ec@@ ial O@@ lym@@ pic@@ s ath@@ let@@ es have pro@@ ved them right four and a half million times over .
Be@@ fore I jo@@ ined Sp@@ ec@@ ial O@@ lym@@ pic@@ s , I was nervous because I was young , sh@@ y , not confi@@ dent and didn &apos;t have many friends .
When I got there , though , everyone was very encour@@ aging , sup@@ por@@ tive , and let me be myself without being jud@@ ged .
Now , I am a bas@@ ket@@ ball player and speed sk@@ ater who has comp@@ eted at pro@@ v@@ in@@ ci@@ al , national games , and this year made it all the way to the World Su@@ m@@ mer G@@ ames in LA , where I was part of the first ever Can@@ adi@@ an bas@@ ket@@ ball team to com@@ pe@@ te at World G@@ ames .
I am one of more than four and a half million ath@@ let@@ es around the globe , and I &apos;ve heard so many similar stories .
Be@@ ing Sp@@ ec@@ ial O@@ lym@@ pic@@ s ath@@ let@@ es rest@@ or@@ es our pri@@ de and dign@@ ity .
Sp@@ ec@@ ial O@@ lym@@ pic@@ s also ad@@ dr@@ esses critical health needs .
Stu@@ dies have shown that , on average , men with intellectu@@ al dis@@ abilities die 13 years youn@@ ger than men without , and women with intellectu@@ al dis@@ abilities die 20 years youn@@ ger than women without .
Sp@@ ec@@ ial O@@ lym@@ pic@@ s kee@@ ps us healthy by getting us active and particip@@ ating in sport .
Al@@ so , our co@@ aches teach us about nutrition and health .
Sp@@ ec@@ ial O@@ lym@@ pic@@ s also provi@@ des free health scre@@ ening for ath@@ let@@ es who have difficul@@ ty communic@@ ating with their doctor or acc@@ essing health care .
At the 20@@ 15 World Su@@ m@@ mer G@@ ames , my T@@ ea@@ m Canada te@@ am@@ mates and I played the Nig@@ er@@ ian bas@@ ket@@ ball team .
The day before our game , the Nig@@ er@@ ian bas@@ ket@@ ball team went to the World G@@ ames He@@ al@@ thy A@@ th@@ le@@ te scre@@ ening , where seven of 10 members were given hearing ai@@ ds for free and got to hear clearly for the first time .
The change in them was amazing .
They were more excited , happy and confi@@ dent , because their co@@ ach could vo@@ cally communicate with them .
And they were emotional because they could hear the sounds of the bas@@ ket@@ ball , the sounds of the wh@@ ist@@ le and the che@@ ering f@@ ans in the st@@ ands -- sounds that we take for gran@@ ted .
Sp@@ ec@@ ial O@@ lym@@ pic@@ s is transform@@ ing more than just the ath@@ le@@ te in their sport .
Sp@@ ec@@ ial O@@ lym@@ pic@@ s is transform@@ ing their lives off the field .
This year , research fin@@ dings showed that nearly half of the adults in the US don &apos;t know a single person with an intellectu@@ al dis@@ ability , and the 4@@ 4 percent of Americans who don &apos;t have personal contact with intellectu@@ al dis@@ abilities are signific@@ antly less accep@@ ting and positive .
Then there &apos;s the r@@ -@@ word , pro@@ ving that people with intellectu@@ al dis@@ abilities are still invisible to far too many people .
People use it as a ca@@ su@@ al term or an insul@@ t .
It was twe@@ eted more than nine million times last year , and it is deeply hur@@ t@@ ful to me and my four and a half million fellow ath@@ let@@ es around the planet .
People don &apos;t think it &apos;s insul@@ ting , but it is .
As my fellow ath@@ le@@ te and global mess@@ eng@@ er John Fr@@ ank@@ lin Steph@@ ens wrote in an open letter to a political pun@@ dit who used the r@@ -@@ word as an insul@@ t , &quot; Come join us some@@ day at Sp@@ ec@@ ial O@@ lym@@ pic@@ s .
See if you walk away with your heart un@@ changed . &quot;
This year , at the 20@@ 15 World Su@@ m@@ mer G@@ ames , people lin@@ ed up for hours to get into the final night of power@@ lif@@ ting competition .
So it was standing room only when my te@@ am@@ mate J@@ ack@@ ie Bar@@ ret@@ t , the New@@ f@@ ound@@ land Mo@@ ose , dea@@ d@@ lif@@ ted 6@@ 5@@ 5 pounds and lif@@ ted 6@@ 11 pounds in the squ@@ at -- setting huge new records for Sp@@ ec@@ ial O@@ lym@@ pic@@ s .
J@@ ack@@ ie is a record hol@@ der among all power@@ lif@@ ters in New@@ f@@ ound@@ land -- not just Sp@@ ec@@ ial O@@ lym@@ pic@@ s , all power@@ lif@@ ters .
J@@ ack@@ ie was a huge star in LA , and E@@ S@@ P@@ N li@@ ve-@@ twe@@ eted his recor@@ d-@@ breaking lif@@ ts and were w@@ ow@@ ed by his performance .
Fi@@ f@@ ty years ago , few imagin@@ ed individuals with intellectu@@ al dis@@ abilities could do anything like that .
This year , 6@@ 0,000 spec@@ tat@@ ors filled the famous LA M@@ em@@ ori@@ al Col@@ is@@ eum to watch the opening cer@@ em@@ on@@ ies of World G@@ ames and che@@ er ath@@ let@@ es from 1@@ 65 countries around the world .
F@@ ar from being hidden away , we were che@@ ered and celebr@@ ated .
Sp@@ ec@@ ial O@@ lym@@ pic@@ s tea@@ ches ath@@ let@@ es to be confi@@ dent and proud of themselves .
Sp@@ ec@@ ial O@@ lym@@ pic@@ s tea@@ ches the world that people with intellectu@@ al dis@@ abilities des@@ erve respect and inclu@@ sion .
Now , I have dreams and achiev@@ ements in my sport , great co@@ aches , respect and dign@@ ity , better health , and I am pur@@ su@@ ing a career as a personal tr@@ ain@@ er .
I am no longer hidden , bul@@ li@@ ed and I am here doing a TED Talk .
The world is a different place because of Sp@@ ec@@ ial O@@ lym@@ pic@@ s , but there is still far@@ ther to go .
So the next time you see someone with an intellectu@@ al dis@@ ability , I hope you will see their ability .
The next time someone uses the r@@ -@@ word near you , I hope you will tell them how much it hur@@ ts .
I hope you will think about getting involved with Sp@@ ec@@ ial O@@ lym@@ pic@@ s .
I would like to leave you with one final thought .
N@@ el@@ son Mand@@ ela said , &quot; S@@ ports has the power to change the world . &quot;
Sp@@ ec@@ ial O@@ lym@@ pic@@ s is changing the world by transform@@ ing four and a half million ath@@ let@@ es and giving us a place to be confi@@ dent , meet friends , not be jud@@ ged and get to feel like and be champi@@ ons .
Thank you very much .
You may never have heard of Ken@@ em@@ a , Si@@ er@@ ra Le@@ one or A@@ ru@@ a , Nigeria .
But I know them as two of the most extraordinary places on earth .
In hospitals there , there &apos;s a community of nur@@ ses , physici@@ ans and scientists that have been qui@@ et@@ ly batt@@ ling one of the dea@@ d@@ li@@ est thre@@ ats to humanity for years : L@@ ass@@ a virus .
L@@ ass@@ a virus is a lot like Ebola .
It can cause a sev@@ ere f@@ ever and can often be fat@@ al .
But these individuals , they risk their lives every day to protect the individuals in their communities , and by doing so , protect us all .
But one of the most extraordinary things I learned about them on one of my first vis@@ its out there many years ago was that they start each morning -- these challeng@@ ing , extraordinary days on the front lines -- by sing@@ ing .
They ga@@ ther together , and they show their joy .
And over the years , from year after year as I &apos;ve vis@@ ited them and they &apos;ve vis@@ ited me , I get to ga@@ ther with them and I sing and we write and we love it , because it re@@ minds us that we &apos;re not just there to pur@@ sue science together ; we &apos;re bon@@ ded through a shared humanity .
And that of course , as you can imagine , becomes extremely important , even essential , as things begin to change .
And that changed a great deal in Mar@@ ch of 20@@ 14 , when the Ebola out@@ break was dec@@ lar@@ ed in Gu@@ ine@@ a .
This is the first out@@ break in West Africa , near the bor@@ der of Si@@ er@@ ra Le@@ one and Li@@ ber@@ ia .
And it was fri@@ ghten@@ ing , fri@@ ghten@@ ing for us all .
We had actually su@@ spec@@ ted for some time that L@@ ass@@ a and Ebola were more wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad than thought , and we thought it could one day come to Ken@@ em@@ a .
And so members of my team immediately went out and jo@@ ined Dr. Hu@@ mar@@ r K@@ h@@ an and his team there , and we set up diagno@@ s@@ tics to be able to have sensitive molecular tests to pick up Ebola if it came across the bor@@ der and into Si@@ er@@ ra Le@@ one .
We &apos;d already set up this kind of capacity for L@@ ass@@ a virus , we knew how to do it , the team is out@@ standing .
We just had to give them the tools and place to sur@@ vey for Ebola .
And unfortunately , that day came .
On M@@ ay 23 , 20@@ 14 , a woman chec@@ ked into the matern@@ ity ward at the hospital , and the team ran those important molecular tests and they identi@@ fied the first confir@@ med case of Ebola in Si@@ er@@ ra Le@@ one .
This was an excep@@ tional work that was done .
They were able to diagno@@ se the case immediately , to saf@@ ely treat the patient and to begin to do contact trac@@ ing to follow what was going on .
It could &apos;ve stopped something .
But by the time that day came , the out@@ break had already been bre@@ eding for months .
With hundreds of cases , it had already ec@@ li@@ p@@ sed all previ@@ ous out@@ brea@@ ks .
And it came into Si@@ er@@ ra Le@@ one not as that sing@@ ular case , but as a ti@@ d@@ al wave .
We had to work with the international community , with the Min@@ istry of Health , with Ken@@ em@@ a , to begin to deal with the cases , as the next week brought 3@@ 1 , then 9@@ 2 , then 14@@ 7 cases -- all coming to Ken@@ em@@ a , one of the only places in Si@@ er@@ ra Le@@ one that could deal with this .
And we worked around the clock trying to do everything we could , trying to help the individuals , trying to get attention , but we also did one other simple thing .
From that spec@@ im@@ en that we take from a patient &apos;s blood to detect Ebola , The other thing we can do is , actually , put in a chemical and de@@ activ@@ ate it , so just place it into a box and ship it across the ocean , and that &apos;s what we did .
We sent it to Boston , where my team works .
And we also worked around the clock doing shift work , day after day , and we quickly gener@@ ated 99 gen@@ om@@ es of the Ebola virus .
This is the blu@@ e@@ print -- the genome of a virus is the blu@@ e@@ print .
We all have one .
It says everything that makes up us , and it tells us so much information .
The results of this kind of work are simple and they &apos;re powerful .
We could actually take these 99 different viruses , look at them and compare them , and we could see , actually , compared to three gen@@ om@@ es that had been previ@@ ously published from Gu@@ ine@@ a , we could show that the out@@ break emerg@@ ed in Gu@@ ine@@ a months before , once into the human population , and from there had been trans@@ m@@ itting from human to human .
Now , that &apos;s incredibly important when you &apos;re trying to figure out how to inter@@ ven@@ e , but the important thing is contact trac@@ ing .
We also could see that as the virus was moving between humans , it was mu@@ tat@@ ing .
And each of those mu@@ tations are so important , because the diagno@@ s@@ tics , the vacc@@ ines , the therap@@ ies that we &apos;re using , are all based on that genome sequence , fundament@@ ally -- that &apos;s what drives it .
And so global health experts would need to respond , would have to develop , to rec@@ ali@@ br@@ ate everything that they were doing .
But the way that science works , the position I was in at that point is , I had the data , and I could have worked in a sil@@ o for many , many months , analy@@ zed the data carefully , slowly , sub@@ mit@@ ted the paper for public@@ ation , gone through a few back@@ -@@ and-@@ for@@ ths , and then finally when the paper came out , might release that data .
That &apos;s the way the status qu@@ o works .
Well , that was not going to work at this point , right ?
We had friends on the front lines and to us it was just obvious that what we needed is help , lots of help .
So the first thing we did is , as soon as the se@@ quences came off the machines , we published it to the web .
We just released it to the whole world and said , &quot; Hel@@ p us . &quot;
And help came .
we were being cont@@ acted from people all over , surprised to see the data out there and released .
Some of the greatest vir@@ al tr@@ ack@@ ers in the world were suddenly part of our community .
We were working together in this virtual way , sharing , regular calls , communications , trying to follow the virus minute by minute , to see ways that we could stop it .
And there are so many ways that we can form communities like that .
Everybody , particularly when the out@@ break started to exp@@ and glob@@ ally , was reach@@ ing out to learn , to particip@@ ate , to engage .
Everybody wants to play a part .
The amount of human capacity out there is just amazing , and the Internet connec@@ ts us all .
And could you imagine that instead of being fri@@ ghten@@ ed of each other , that we all just said , &quot; Let &apos;s do this .
Let &apos;s work together , and let &apos;s make this happen . &quot;
But the problem is that the data that all of us are using , Goo@@ gl@@ ing on the web , is just too limited to do what we need to do .
And so many opportunities get miss@@ ed when that happens .
So in the early part of the epidemic from Ken@@ em@@ a , we &apos;d had 10@@ 6 clinical records from patients , and we once again made that public@@ ly available to the world .
And in our own lab , we could show that you could take those 10@@ 6 records , we could train computers to predict the pro@@ g@@ no@@ sis for Ebola patients to near 100 percent accur@@ acy .
And we made an ap@@ p that could release that , to make that available to health@@ -@@ care workers in the field .
But 10@@ 6 is just not enough to make it powerful , to val@@ id@@ ate it .
So we were waiting for more data to release that .
and the data has still not come .
We are still waiting , tw@@ ea@@ king away , in sil@@ os rather than working together .
And this just -- we can &apos;t accept that .
Right ? You , all of you , cannot accept that .
It &apos;s our lives on the line .
many lives were lost , many health@@ -@@ care workers , including bel@@ o@@ ved colleagues of mine , five colleagues : M@@ bal@@ u F@@ onn@@ ie , Ale@@ x Mo@@ ig@@ bo@@ i , Dr. Hu@@ mar@@ r K@@ h@@ an , A@@ lice Ko@@ v@@ om@@ a and Mo@@ ham@@ ed F@@ ul@@ la@@ h .
These are just five of many health@@ -@@ care workers at Ken@@ em@@ a and beyond that died while the world wai@@ ted and while we all worked , qui@@ et@@ ly and separ@@ ately .
See , Ebola , like all thre@@ ats to humanity , it &apos;s fu@@ eled by mis@@ trust and distr@@ action and di@@ vision .
When we build barri@@ ers am@@ ong@@ st ourselves and we fight am@@ ong@@ st ourselves , the virus th@@ ri@@ ves .
But un@@ like all thre@@ ats to humanity , Ebola is one where we &apos;re actually all the same .
We &apos;re all in this fight together .
Ebola on one person &apos;s do@@ or@@ step could soon be on ours .
And so in this place with the same vulner@@ abilities , the same str@@ eng@@ ths , the same f@@ ears , the same hop@@ es , I hope that we work together with joy .
A graduate student of mine was reading a book about Si@@ er@@ ra Le@@ one , and she discovered that the word &quot; Ken@@ em@@ a , &quot; the hospital that we work at and the city where we work in Si@@ er@@ ra Le@@ one , is named after the M@@ en@@ de word for &quot; clear like a river , trans@@ lu@@ cent and open to the public g@@ az@@ e . &quot;
That was really profound for us , because without knowing it , we &apos;d always felt that in order to hon@@ or the individuals in Ken@@ em@@ a where we worked , we had to work open@@ ly , we had to share and we had to work together .
And we have to do that .
We all have to demand that of ourselves and others -- to be open to each other when an out@@ break happens , to fight in this fight together .
Because this is not the first out@@ break of Ebola , it will not be the last , and there are many other microbes out there that are lying in wait , like L@@ ass@@ a virus and others .
And the next time this happens , it could happen in a city of millions , it could start there .
It could be something that &apos;s trans@@ mit@@ ted through the air .
It could even be dis@@ sem@@ in@@ ated in@@ tenti@@ on@@ ally .
And I know that that is fri@@ ghten@@ ing , I understand that , but I know also , and this experience shows us , that we have the technology and we have the capacity to win this thing , to win this and have the up@@ per hand over viruses .
But we can only do it if we do it together and we do it with joy .
So for Dr. K@@ h@@ an and for all of those who sacri@@ fic@@ ed their lives on the front lines in this fight with us always , let us be in this fight with them always .
And let us not let the world be defined by the destruction wr@@ ought by one virus , but illu@@ min@@ ated by billions of hear@@ ts and minds working in un@@ ity .
Thank you .
