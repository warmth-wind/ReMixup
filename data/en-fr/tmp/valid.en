Last year I showed these two sli@@ des so that demonstr@@ ate that the ar@@ c@@ tic ice ca@@ p , which for most of the last three million years has been the size of the lower 4@@ 8 states , has sh@@ run@@ k by 40 percent .
But this underst@@ ates the seri@@ ousness of this particular problem because it doesn &apos;t show the th@@ ick@@ ness of the ice .
The ar@@ c@@ tic ice ca@@ p is , in a sense , the be@@ ating heart of the global climate system .
It exp@@ ands in win@@ ter and contr@@ acts in summer .
The next slide I show you will be a rap@@ id fas@@ t-@@ forward of what &apos;s happened over the last 25 years .
The permanent ice is mar@@ ked in red .
As you see , it exp@@ ands to the dark blue -- that &apos;s the annu@@ al ice in win@@ ter , and it contr@@ acts in summer .
The so@@ -@@ called permanent ice , five years old or older , you can see is almost like blood , sp@@ illing out of the body here .
In 25 years it &apos;s gone from this , to this .
This is a problem because the warming he@@ ats up the fro@@ zen ground around the Ar@@ c@@ tic O@@ ce@@ an , where there is a massive amount of fro@@ zen carbon which , when it th@@ a@@ ws , is turned into meth@@ ane by microbes .
Com@@ par@@ ed to the total amount of global warming pollution in the atmosphere , that amount could double if we cross this ti@@ pping point .
Al@@ ready in some sh@@ allow la@@ kes in Al@@ as@@ ka , meth@@ ane is activ@@ ely bu@@ b@@ bling up out of the water .
Pro@@ f@@ essor K@@ at@@ ey Wal@@ ter from the University of Al@@ as@@ ka went out with another team to another sh@@ allow la@@ ke last win@@ ter .
V@@ ide@@ o : Wh@@ o@@ a ! Al Gore : She &apos;s okay . The question is whether we will be .
And one reason is , this enormous heat sin@@ k he@@ ats up Green@@ land from the nor@@ th .
This is an annu@@ al mel@@ ting river .
But the volu@@ mes are much larger than ever .
This is the K@@ anger@@ l@@ us@@ su@@ a@@ q Ri@@ ver in sou@@ th@@ west Green@@ land .
If you want to know how sea level ris@@ es from land@@ -@@ base ice mel@@ ting this is where it re@@ aches the sea .
These flo@@ ws are increasing very rapidly .
At the other end of the planet , Antarc@@ tic@@ a the largest mass of ice on the planet .
Last month scientists re@@ ported the entire continent is now in negative ice balance .
And west Antarc@@ tic@@ a cro@@ pped up on top some under@@ -@@ sea is@@ lands , is particularly rap@@ id in its mel@@ ting .
That &apos;s equal to 20 feet of sea level , as is Green@@ land .
In the H@@ im@@ al@@ ay@@ as , the third largest mass of ice : at the top you see new la@@ kes , which a few years ago were gl@@ aci@@ ers .
40 percent of all the people in the world get half of their dr@@ inking water from that mel@@ ting flow .
In the An@@ des , this gl@@ acier is the source of dr@@ inking water for this city .
The flo@@ ws have increas@@ ed .
But when they go away , so does much of the dr@@ inking water .
In California there has been a 40 percent dec@@ line in the Si@@ er@@ ra s@@ now@@ p@@ ack .
This is h@@ itting the res@@ er@@ vo@@ irs .
And the predic@@ tions , as you &apos;ve read , are serious .
This dr@@ ying around the world has lead to a dram@@ atic increase in fi@@ res .
And the dis@@ as@@ ters around the world have been increasing at an absolutely extraordinary and un@@ pre@@ ce@@ d@@ ented rate .
F@@ our times as many in the last 30 years as in the previ@@ ous 75 .
This is a completely un@@ sustainable pattern .
If you look at in the context of history you can see what this is doing .
In the last five years we &apos;ve ad@@ ded 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons every day to the oceans .
Look carefully at the area of the eas@@ tern Paci@@ fic , from the Americ@@ as , ext@@ ending w@@ es@@ tw@@ ard , and on either side of the Indian sub@@ continent , where there is a radical de@@ ple@@ tion of oxygen in the oceans .
The biggest single cause of global warming , along with de@@ forestation , which is 20 percent of it , is the bur@@ ning of fossi@@ l fu@@ els .
O@@ il is a problem , and coal is the most serious problem .
The United States is one of the two largest em@@ it@@ ters , along with China .
And the propos@@ al has been to build a lot more coal plants .
But we &apos;re beginning to see a sea change .
Here are the ones that have been can@@ cel@@ led in the last few years with some green altern@@ atives pro@@ posed .
However there is a political bat@@ tle in our country .
And the coal industries and the oil industries spent a quar@@ ter of a billion dollars in the last cal@@ end@@ ar year prom@@ oting clean coal , which is an oxy@@ mor@@ on .
That image re@@ min@@ ded me of something .
Ar@@ ound Christ@@ mas , in my home in T@@ enn@@ es@@ see , a billion g@@ allons of coal slu@@ dge was sp@@ illed .
You probably saw it on the news .
This , all over the country , is the second largest waste stream in America .
This happened around Christ@@ mas .
One of the coal industry &apos;s ads around Christ@@ mas was this one .
V@@ ide@@ o : ♪ ♫ Fro@@ st@@ y the coal man is a j@@ ol@@ ly , happy sou@@ l .
He &apos;s ab@@ un@@ dant here in America , and he helps our economy grow .
Fro@@ st@@ y the coal man is getting clean@@ er everyday .
He &apos;s aff@@ ord@@ able and ador@@ able , and workers keep their pay .
Al Gore : This is the source of much of the coal in West Vir@@ gin@@ ia .
The largest mount@@ ain@@ top min@@ er is the head of M@@ asse@@ y Co@@ al .
V@@ ide@@ o : Don B@@ lan@@ k@@ en@@ ship : Let me be clear about it . Al Gore , N@@ ancy P@@ el@@ o@@ si , H@@ arry Re@@ id , they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al Gore : So the Al@@ li@@ ance for C@@ lim@@ ate Pr@@ ot@@ ection has launched two campaig@@ ns .
This is one of them , part of one of them .
V@@ ide@@ o : Ac@@ tor : At CO@@ A@@ L@@ ergy we view climate change as a very serious threat to our business .
That &apos;s why we &apos;ve made it our prim@@ ary goal to spend a large sum of money on an adver@@ tis@@ ing effort to help bring out and complic@@ ate the truth about coal .
The fact is , coal isn &apos;t dir@@ ty .
We think it &apos;s clean -- sm@@ el@@ ls good , too .
So don &apos;t worry about climate change .
Le@@ ave that up to us .
V@@ ide@@ o : Ac@@ tor : C@@ le@@ an coal -- you &apos;ve heard a lot about it .
So let &apos;s take a tour of this stat@@ e-@@ of@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ art clean coal facil@@ ity .
Amaz@@ ing ! The mach@@ in@@ ery is kind of l@@ oud .
But that &apos;s the sound of clean coal technology .
And while bur@@ ning coal is one of the leading causes of global warming , the remarkable clean coal technology you see here changes everything .
Take a good long look : this is today &apos;s clean coal technology .
Al Gore : Fin@@ ally , the positive alternative mes@@ h@@ es with our economic challenge and our national security challenge .
V@@ ide@@ o : Narr@@ ator : America is in crisis -- the economy , national security , the climate crisis .
The th@@ read that lin@@ ks them all : our ad@@ diction to carbon based fu@@ els , like dir@@ ty coal and foreign oil .
But now there is a b@@ old new solution to get us out of this m@@ ess .
Re@@ power America with 100 percent clean electricity within 10 years .
A plan to put America back to work , make us more sec@@ ure , and help stop global warming .
Fin@@ ally , a solution that &apos;s big enough to solve our problems .
Re@@ power America . F@@ ind out more .
Al Gore : This is the last one .
V@@ ide@@ o : Narr@@ ator : It &apos;s about re@@ power@@ ing America .
One of the fas@@ test ways to cut our depend@@ ence on old dir@@ ty fu@@ els that are killing our planet .
Man : F@@ u@@ ture &apos;s over here . W@@ ind , sun , a new energy gri@@ d .
Man # 2 : New invest@@ ments to create high-@@ paying jobs .
Narr@@ ator : Re@@ power America . It &apos;s time to get real .
Al Gore : There is an old African pro@@ ver@@ b that says , &quot; If you want to go quickly , go alone .
If you want to go far , go together . &quot;
We need to go far , quickly .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED I gave an intro@@ duction to the L@@ H@@ C .
And I prom@@ is@@ ed to come back and give you an up@@ date on how that machine worked .
So this is it . And for those of you that weren &apos;t there , the L@@ H@@ C is the largest scientific experiment ever attemp@@ ted -- 27 kilometers in circum@@ ference .
I@@ ts job is to re@@ create the conditions that were present less than a billi@@ on@@ th of a second after the universe began , up to 600 million times a second .
It &apos;s nothing if not ambi@@ tious .
This is the machine below Gen@@ ev@@ a .
We take the pictures of those min@@ i-@@ Big B@@ ang@@ s inside det@@ ect@@ ors .
This is the one I work on . It &apos;s called the A@@ T@@ L@@ A@@ S det@@ ect@@ or -- 4@@ 4 meters wide , 22 meters in diam@@ eter .
Sp@@ ect@@ ac@@ ular picture here of A@@ T@@ L@@ A@@ S under construction so you can see the scale .
On the 10@@ th of Sep@@ t@@ ember last year we turned the machine on for the first time .
And this picture was taken by A@@ T@@ L@@ A@@ S .
It caused immense celebr@@ ation in the control room .
It &apos;s a picture of the first b@@ ea@@ m parti@@ cle going all the way around the L@@ H@@ C , col@@ li@@ ding with a piece of the L@@ H@@ C deli@@ ber@@ ately , and sho@@ wer@@ ing particles into the det@@ ect@@ or .
In other words , when we saw that picture on Sep@@ t@@ ember 10@@ th we knew the machine worked , which is a great tri@@ u@@ mp@@ h .
I don &apos;t know whether this got the biggest che@@ er , or this , when someone went onto Google and saw the front page was like that .
It means we made cultural impact as well as scientific impact .
A@@ bout a week later we had a problem with the machine , related actually to these bits of w@@ ire here -- these gold wi@@ res .
Those wi@@ res carry 13 thousand am@@ ps when the machine is working in full power .
Now the engineers am@@ ong@@ st you will look at them and say , &quot; No they don &apos;t . They &apos;re small wi@@ res . &quot;
They can do that because when they are very cold they are what &apos;s called super@@ conduc@@ ting w@@ ire .
So at min@@ us 2@@ 7@@ 1 degrees , col@@ der than the space between the stars , those wi@@ res can take that current .
In one of the jo@@ ints between over 9@@ ,000 mag@@ nets in L@@ H@@ C , there was a manufactu@@ ring def@@ ect .
So the w@@ ire he@@ ated up slightly , and its 1@@ 3,000 am@@ ps suddenly en@@ coun@@ tered electrical res@@ istance .
This was the result .
Now that &apos;s more impres@@ sive when you consider those mag@@ nets we@@ igh over 20 tons , and they moved about a foot .
So we dam@@ aged about 50 of the mag@@ nets .
We had to take them out , which we did .
We re@@ condi@@ tion@@ ed them all , fix@@ ed them .
They &apos;re all on their way back under@@ ground now .
By the end of Mar@@ ch the L@@ H@@ C will be int@@ act again .
We will switch it on , and we expect to take data in J@@ une or Ju@@ ly , and continue with our qu@@ est to find out what the building blocks of the universe are .
Now of course , in a way those accidents re@@ ign@@ ite the debate about the value of science and engineering at the edge . It &apos;s easy to refu@@ te .
I think that the fact that it &apos;s so difficult , the fact that we &apos;re over@@ reach@@ ing , is the value of things like the L@@ H@@ C .
I will leave the final word to an English scientist , H@@ um@@ ph@@ re@@ y Dav@@ y , who , I susp@@ ect , when def@@ ending his prot@@ e@@ ge &apos;s us@@ eless experiments -- his prot@@ e@@ ge was Michael F@@ ar@@ ad@@ ay -- said this , &quot; No@@ thing is so dangerous to the progress of the human mind than to assu@@ me that our vie@@ ws of science are ul@@ timate , that there are no myst@@ eries in nature , that our tri@@ um@@ ph@@ s are complete , and that there are no new worlds to con@@ quer . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start out by asking you to think back to when you were a kid , playing with blocks .
As you figured out how to reach out and gr@@ as@@ p , pick them up and move them around , you were actually learning how to think and solve problems by understanding and manipul@@ ating spatial relationships .
S@@ pati@@ al reas@@ oning is deeply connected to how we understand a lot of the world around us .
So , as a computer scientist inspired by this util@@ ity of our interactions with physical objects -- along with my ad@@ vis@@ er P@@ atti@@ e , and my collabor@@ ator Je@@ ev@@ an K@@ al@@ ani@@ th@@ i -- I started to wonder -- what if when we used a computer , instead of having this one mouse cur@@ s@@ or that was a like a digital fin@@ ger@@ ti@@ p moving around a fl@@ at des@@ k@@ top , what if we could reach in with both hands and gr@@ as@@ p information physi@@ cally ,
arrang@@ ing it the way we wanted ?
This question was so comp@@ elling that we decided to explore the answer , by building Si@@ f@@ tables .
In a nu@@ t@@ sh@@ ell , a Si@@ f@@ table is an inter@@ active computer the size of a co@@ ok@@ ie .
They &apos;re able to be moved around by hand , they can sense each other , they can sense their motion , and they have a screen and a wi@@ rel@@ ess radio .
Most importantly , they &apos;re physical , so like the blocks , you can move them just by reach@@ ing out and gr@@ as@@ ping .
And Si@@ f@@ tables are an example of a new eco@@ system of tools for manipul@@ ating digital information .
And as these tools become more physical , more aware of their motion , aware of each other , and aware of the nu@@ ance of how we move them , we can start to explore some new and fun interaction sty@@ les .
So , I &apos;m going to start with some simple examples .
This Si@@ f@@ table is con@@ figured to show video , and if I til@@ t it in one direction , it &apos;ll roll the video this way ; if I til@@ t it the other way it rol@@ ls it back@@ wards .
And these inter@@ active por@@ traits are aware of each other .
So if I put them next to each other , they get interested .
If they get surr@@ ounded , they notice that too , they might get a little flu@@ st@@ ered .
And they can also sense their motion and til@@ t .
One of the interesting implications on interaction , we started to realize , was that we could use everyday ges@@ tures on data , like pour@@ ing a color the way we might pour a liqui@@ d .
So in this case , we &apos;ve got three Si@@ f@@ tables con@@ figured to be paint bu@@ ck@@ ets and I can use them to pour color into that central one , where they get mix@@ ed .
If we over@@ sho@@ ot , we can pour a little bit back .
There are also some ne@@ at possibilities for education , like language , math and logic games where we want to give people the ability to try things quickly , and view the results immediately .
So here I &apos;m -- This is a Fi@@ bon@@ ac@@ ci sequence that I &apos;m making with a simple equ@@ ation program .
Here we have a word game that &apos;s kind of like a mas@@ h@@ -up between S@@ cr@@ ab@@ ble and Bo@@ gg@@ le .
Bas@@ ically , in every round you get a rand@@ om@@ ly as@@ signed letter on each Si@@ f@@ table , and as you try to make words it chec@@ ks against a dic@@ tionary .
Then , after about 30 seconds , it res@@ hu@@ ff@@ les , and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
So these are some kids that came on a field trip to the Me@@ dia Lab , and I managed to get them to try it out , and sho@@ ot a video .
They really loved it .
And , one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don &apos;t have to give people many instructions .
All you have to say is , &quot; M@@ ake words , &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
So here &apos;s another few people trying it out .
That &apos;s our youn@@ g@@ est bet@@ a tes@@ ter , down there on the right .
Tur@@ ns out , all he wanted to do was to st@@ ack the Si@@ f@@ tables up .
So to him , they were just blocks .
Now , this is an inter@@ active carto@@ on application .
And we wanted to build a learning tool for language lear@@ ners .
And this is F@@ eli@@ x , actually .
And he can bring new characters into the scene , just by lif@@ ting the Si@@ f@@ tables off the table that have that character shown on them .
Here , he &apos;s bringing the sun out .
V@@ ide@@ o : The sun is ris@@ ing .
David Mer@@ r@@ ill : Now he &apos;s brought a tr@@ actor into the scene .
V@@ ide@@ o : The orange tr@@ actor .
Good job ! Yeah !
D@@ M : So by sh@@ aking the Si@@ f@@ tables and putting them next to each other he can make the characters interact -- V@@ ide@@ o : W@@ o@@ of !
D@@ M : invent@@ ing his own narrative .
V@@ ide@@ o : H@@ ell@@ o !
D@@ M : It &apos;s an open-@@ ended story , and he gets to decide how it un@@ fol@@ ds .
V@@ ide@@ o : F@@ ly away , cat .
D@@ M : So , the last example I have time to show you today is a music se@@ qu@@ encing and live performance tool that we &apos;ve built recently , in which Si@@ f@@ tables act as sounds like lead , bas@@ s and dru@@ ms .
Each of these has four different variations , you get to choose which one you want to use .
And you can inj@@ ect these sounds into a sequence that you can assemble into the pattern that you want .
And you inj@@ ect it by just bu@@ mp@@ ing up the sound Si@@ f@@ table against a sequence Si@@ f@@ table .
There are effects that you can control live , like re@@ ver@@ b and fil@@ ter .
You att@@ ach it to a particular sound and then til@@ t to ad@@ just it .
And then , over@@ all effects like temp@@ o and volume that apply to the entire sequence .
So let &apos;s have a look .
V@@ ide@@ o : D@@ M : We &apos;ll start by putting a lead into two sequence Si@@ f@@ tables , arr@@ ange them into a series , ex@@ tend it , add a little more lead .
Now I put a bas@@ s line in .
V@@ ide@@ o : D@@ M : Now I &apos;ll put some per@@ cus@@ sion in .
V@@ ide@@ o : D@@ M : And now I &apos;ll att@@ ach the fil@@ ter to the dru@@ ms , so I can control the effect live .
V@@ ide@@ o : D@@ M : I can speed up the whole sequence by til@@ ting the temp@@ o one way or the other .
V@@ ide@@ o : D@@ M : And now I &apos;ll att@@ ach the fil@@ ter to the bas@@ s for some more expression .
V@@ ide@@ o : D@@ M : I can re@@ arr@@ ange the sequence while it plays .
So I don &apos;t have to plan it out in adv@@ ance , but I can improvis@@ e , making it longer or shor@@ ter as I go .
And now , finally , I can fa@@ de the whole sequence out using the volume Si@@ f@@ table , til@@ ted to the left .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is for making new human@@ -@@ computer inter@@ faces that are a better match to the ways our brains and bodies work .
And today , I had time to show you one point in this new design space , and a few of the possibilities that we &apos;re working to bring out of the labor@@ atory .
So the thought I want to leave you with is that we &apos;re on the cus@@ p of this new generation of tools for inter@@ acting with digital media that are going to bring information into our world on our terms .
Thank you very much .
I look forward to talking with all of you .
I am a writer .
W@@ r@@ iting books is my prof@@ ession but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It is also my great li@@ fel@@ ong love and fascin@@ ation .
And I don &apos;t expect that that &apos;s ever going to change .
But , that said , something kind of p@@ ecu@@ li@@ ar has happened recently in my life and in my career , which has caused me to have to rec@@ ali@@ br@@ ate my whole relationship with this work .
And the p@@ ecu@@ li@@ ar thing is that I recently wrote this book , this mem@@ oir called &quot; E@@ at , Pr@@ ay , Lo@@ ve &quot; which , dec@@ ide@@ dly un@@ like any of my previ@@ ous books , went out in the world for some reason , and became this big , me@@ g@@ a-@@ sensation , international bes@@ t@@ sel@@ ler thing .
The result of which is that everywhere I go now , people treat me like I &apos;m do@@ om@@ ed .
Ser@@ i@@ ously -- do@@ om@@ ed , do@@ om@@ ed !
Like , they come up to me now , all worried , and they say , &quot; A@@ ren &apos;t you afraid you &apos;re never going to be able to top that ?
A@@ ren &apos;t you afraid you &apos;re going to keep writing for your whole life and you &apos;re never again going to create a book that anybody in the world car@@ es about at all , ever again ? &quot;
So that &apos;s reas@@ suring , you know .
But it would be worse , except for that I happen to remember that over 20 years ago , when I was a teen@@ ager , when I first started telling people that I wanted to be a writer , I was met with this same sort of f@@ ear@@ -@@ based reaction .
And people would say , &quot; A@@ ren &apos;t you afraid you &apos;re never going to have any success ?
A@@ ren &apos;t you afraid the humi@@ li@@ ation of rej@@ ection will kill you ?
A@@ ren &apos;t you afraid that you &apos;re going to work your whole life at this craft and nothing &apos;s ever going to come of it and you &apos;re going to die on a scr@@ ap hea@@ p of broken dreams with your mouth filled with bit@@ ter ash of failure ? &quot;
Like that , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all those questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yes , I &apos;m afraid of all those things .
And I always have been .
And I &apos;m afraid of many , many more things bes@@ ides that people can &apos;t even guess at , like s@@ ea@@ we@@ ed and other things that are scar@@ y .
But , when it comes to writing , the thing that I &apos;ve been sort of thinking about l@@ ately , and wondering about l@@ ately , is why ?
You know , is it rational ?
Is it logical that anybody should be expected to be afraid of the work that they feel they were put on this Earth to do .
And what is it specifically about creative ven@@ tures that seems to make us really nervous about each other &apos;s mental health in a way that other care@@ ers kind of don &apos;t do , you know ?
Like my dad , for example , was a chemical engineer and I don &apos;t rec@@ all once in his 40 years of chemical engineering anybody asking him if he was afraid to be a chemical engineer , you know ?
&quot; That chem@@ ic@@ al-@@ engineering block , John , how &apos;s it going ? &quot;
It just didn &apos;t come up like that , you know ?
But to be fair , chemical engineers as a group haven &apos;t really ear@@ ned a re@@ putation over the centu@@ ries for being al@@ co@@ ho@@ lic man@@ ic@@ -@@ de@@ pres@@ si@@ ves .
We writ@@ ers , we kind of do have that re@@ putation , and not just writ@@ ers , but creative people across all gen@@ res , it seems , have this re@@ putation for being enorm@@ ously ment@@ ally un@@ stable .
And all you have to do is look at the very gri@@ m death count in the 20th century alone , of really magni@@ fic@@ ent creative minds who died young and often at their own hands , you know ?
And even the ones who didn &apos;t literally comm@@ it suicide seem to be really un@@ done by their gi@@ f@@ ts , you know .
Nor@@ man M@@ ail@@ er , just before he died , last interview , he said , &quot; Every one of my books has killed me a little more . &quot;
An extraordinary stat@@ ement to make about your life &apos;s work .
But we don &apos;t even bl@@ ink when we hear somebody say this , because we &apos;ve heard that kind of stuff for so long and somehow we &apos;ve completely intern@@ alized and accep@@ ted collec@@ tively this notion that creativity and suffering are somehow inher@@ ently lin@@ ked and that arti@@ str@@ y , in the end , will always ultimately lead to angu@@ ish .
And the question that I want to ask everybody here today is are you guys all cool with that idea ?
Are you comfortable with that ?
Because you look at it even from an in@@ ch away and , you know -- I &apos;m not at all comfortable with that assu@@ mption .
I think it &apos;s o@@ di@@ ous .
And I also think it &apos;s dangerous , and I don &apos;t want to see it per@@ p@@ et@@ u@@ ated into the next century .
I think it &apos;s better if we encourage our great creative minds to live .
And I definitely know that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous for me to start sort of lea@@ king down that dark path of assu@@ mption , particularly given the circumst@@ ance that I &apos;m in right now in my career .
Which is -- you know , like check it out , I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;m only about 40 years old .
I still have maybe another four decades of work left in me .
And it &apos;s ex@@ ce@@ ed@@ ingly likely that anything I write from this point forward is going to be jud@@ ged by the world as the work that came after the fre@@ ak@@ ish success of my last book , right ?
I should just put it bl@@ un@@ tly , because we &apos;re all sort of friends here now -- it &apos;s ex@@ ce@@ ed@@ ingly likely that my greatest success is behind me .
So J@@ es@@ us , what a thought !
That &apos;s the kind of thought that could lead a person to start dr@@ inking g@@ in at nine o &apos;@@ clock in the morning , and I don &apos;t want to go there .
I would pre@@ fer to keep doing this work that I love .
And so , the question becomes , how ?
And so , it seems to me , upon a lot of refl@@ ection , that the way that I have to work now , in order to continue writing , is that I have to create some sort of prot@@ ective psycho@@ logical construc@@ t , right ?
I have to sort of find some way to have a safe distance between me , as I am writing , and my very natural anxi@@ ety about what the reaction to that writing is going to be , from now on .
And , as I &apos;ve been looking , over the last year , for models for how to do that , I &apos;ve been sort of looking across time , and I &apos;ve been trying to find other societies to see if they might have had better and san@@ er ideas than we have about how to help creative people sort of manage the inher@@ ent emotional risks of creativity .
And that search has led me to ancient Gre@@ e@@ ce and ancient Rome .
So stay with me , because it does circle around and back .
But , ancient Gre@@ e@@ ce and ancient Rome -- people did not happen to believe that creativity came from human beings back then , OK ?
People believed that creativity was this div@@ ine attend@@ ant spirit that came to human beings from some dis@@ tant and un@@ know@@ able source , for dis@@ tant and un@@ know@@ able reasons .
The Gre@@ e@@ ks fam@@ ously called these div@@ ine attend@@ ant spir@@ its of creativity &quot; d@@ a@@ em@@ ons . &quot;
So@@ cr@@ ates , fam@@ ously , believed that he had a d@@ a@@ em@@ on who spoke wisdom to him from af@@ ar .
The Rom@@ ans had the same idea , but they called that sort of dis@@ em@@ bo@@ died creative spirit a gen@@ i@@ us .
Which is great , because the Rom@@ ans did not actually think that a gen@@ i@@ us was a particularly cl@@ ever individual .
They believed that a gen@@ i@@ us was this , sort of mag@@ ical div@@ ine enti@@ ty , who was believed to literally live in the walls of an artist &apos;s studio , kind of like D@@ ob@@ by the house el@@ f , and who would come out and sort of in@@ visi@@ bly ass@@ ist the artist with their work and would shape the out@@ come of that work .
So brilliant -- there it is , right there , that distance that I &apos;m talking about -- that psycho@@ logical construc@@ t to protect you from the results of your work .
And everyone knew that this is how it func@@ tion@@ ed , right ?
So the ancient artist was protected from certain things , like , for example , too much nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism , right ?
If your work was brilliant , you couldn &apos;t take all the credit for it , everybody knew that you had this dis@@ em@@ bo@@ died gen@@ i@@ us who had helped you .
If your work bomb@@ ed , not entirely your fau@@ lt , you know ?
Every@@ one knew your gen@@ i@@ us was kind of l@@ ame .
And this is how people thought about creativity in the West for a really long time .
And then the R@@ en@@ aiss@@ ance came and everything changed , and we had this big idea , and the big idea was , let &apos;s put the individual human being at the center of the universe above all go@@ ds and myst@@ eries , and there &apos;s no more room for my@@ s@@ tical creatures who take dic@@ tation from the div@@ ine .
And it &apos;s the beginning of rational human@@ ism , and people started to believe that creativity came completely from the self of the individual .
And for the first time in history , you start to hear people refer@@ ring to this or that artist as being a gen@@ i@@ us , rather than having a gen@@ i@@ us .
And I got to tell you , I think that was a huge er@@ ror .
You know , I think that allo@@ wing somebody , one m@@ ere person to believe that he or she is like , the v@@ es@@ sel , you know , like the font and the essence and the source of all div@@ ine , creative , un@@ know@@ able , et@@ ern@@ al myst@@ ery is just a s@@ mi@@ dge too much responsibility to put on one frag@@ ile , human psy@@ che .
It &apos;s like asking somebody to s@@ wal@@ low the sun .
It just completely war@@ ps and dist@@ or@@ ts e@@ go@@ s , and it creates all these un@@ man@@ age@@ able expect@@ ations about performance .
And I think the pressure of that has been killing off our artists for the last 500 years .
And , if this is true , and I think it is true , the question becomes , what now ?
Can we do this differently ?
Maybe go back to some more ancient understanding about the relationship between humans and the creative myst@@ ery .
Maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t just er@@ ase 500 years of rational human@@ istic thought in one 18 minute speech .
And there &apos;s probably people in this audience who would raise really le@@ gi@@ timate scientific susp@@ ici@@ ons about the notion of , basically , fai@@ ries who follow people around ru@@ b@@ bing fai@@ ry ju@@ ice on their projects and stuff .
I &apos;m not , probably , going to bring you all along with me on this .
But the question that I kind of want to pose is -- you know , why not ?
Why not think about it this way ?
Because it makes as much sense as anything else I have ever heard in terms of expl@@ aining the ut@@ ter ma@@ dd@@ ening ca@@ pr@@ ici@@ ousness of the creative process .
A process which , as anybody who has ever tried to make something -- which is to say basically everyone here -@@ -- knows does not always be@@ have r@@ ation@@ ally .
And , in fact , can sometimes feel down@@ right par@@ an@@ or@@ mal .
where I met the extraordinary American po@@ et Ru@@ th St@@ one , who &apos;s now in her 9@@ 0s , but she &apos;s been a po@@ et her entire life and she told me that when she was growing up in rural Vir@@ gin@@ ia , she would be out working in the fields , and she said she would feel and hear a poem coming at her from over the landscape .
And she said it was like a th@@ under@@ ous train of air .
And it would come bar@@ rel@@ ing down at her over the landscape .
And she felt it coming , because it would sh@@ ake the earth under her feet .
She knew that she had only one thing to do at that point , and that was to , in her words , &quot; run like hell . &quot;
And she would run like hell to the house and she would be getting ch@@ ased by this poem , and the whole deal was that she had to get to a piece of paper and a pen@@ c@@ il fast enough so that when it th@@ under@@ ed through her , she could collect it and gra@@ b it on the page .
And other times she wouldn &apos;t be fast enough , so she &apos;d be running and running , and she wouldn &apos;t get to the house and the poem would bar@@ rel through her and she would mis@@ s it and she said it would continue on across the landscape , looking , as she put it &quot; for another po@@ et . &quot;
And then there were these times -- this is the piece I never for@@ got -- she said that there were moments where she would almost mis@@ s it , right ?
So , she &apos;s running to the house and she &apos;s looking for the paper and the poem pas@@ ses through her , and she gr@@ ab@@ s a pen@@ c@@ il just as it &apos;s going through her , and then she said , it was like she would reach out with her other hand and she would catch it .
She would catch the poem by its tail , and she would pull it back@@ wards into her body as she was trans@@ cri@@ bing on the page .
And in these inst@@ ances , the poem would come up on the page perfect and int@@ act but back@@ wards , from the last word to the first .
So when I heard that I was like -- that &apos;s un@@ c@@ anny , that &apos;s exactly what my creative process is like .
That &apos;s not at all what my creative process is -- I &apos;m not the pi@@ pel@@ ine !
I &apos;m a mu@@ le , and the way that I have to work is I have to get up at the same time every day , and swe@@ at and labor and bar@@ rel through it really aw@@ k@@ war@@ dly .
But even I , in my mul@@ ish@@ ness , even I have br@@ ush@@ ed up against that thing , at times .
And I would imagine that a lot of you have too .
You know , even I have had work or ideas come through me from a source that I hon@@ est@@ ly cannot identify .
And what is that thing ?
And how are we to rel@@ ate to it in a way that will not make us lose our minds , but , in fact , might actually keep us san@@ e ?
And for me , the best contempor@@ ary example that I have of how to do that is the musici@@ an Tom W@@ ai@@ ts , who I got to interview several years ago on a magazine as@@ sign@@ ment .
And we were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of his life , he was pretty much the em@@ bo@@ di@@ ment of the tor@@ ment@@ ed contempor@@ ary modern artist , trying to control and manage and domin@@ ate these sort of un@@ controll@@ able creative impul@@ ses that were totally intern@@ alized .
But then he got older , he got cal@@ mer , and one day he was driving down the free@@ way in Los Angeles , and this is when it all changed for him .
And he &apos;s spe@@ eding along , and all of a sudden he hear@@ s this little frag@@ ment of mel@@ o@@ dy , that comes into his head as inspiration often comes , el@@ u@@ sive and tan@@ tal@@ izing , and he wants it , it &apos;s gor@@ ge@@ ous , and he lon@@ gs for it , but he has no way to get it .
He doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , or a pen@@ c@@ il , or a tape recor@@ der .
So he starts to feel all of that old anxi@@ ety start to rise in him like , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose this thing , and I &apos;ll be be hau@@ n@@ ted by this song forever .
I &apos;m not good enough , and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of pan@@ ic@@ king , he just stopped .
He just stopped that whole mental process and he did something completely nov@@ el .
He just looked up at the sky , and he said , &quot; Ex@@ cu@@ se me , can you not see that I &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; Do I look like I can write down a song right now ?
If you really want to exist , come back at a more op@@ port@@ une moment when I can take care of you .
O@@ ther@@ wise , go bo@@ ther somebody else today .
Go bo@@ ther Le@@ on@@ ard Co@@ h@@ en . &quot;
And his whole work process changed after that .
Not the work , the work was still of@@ ten@@ times as dark as ever .
But the process , and the heavy anxi@@ ety around it was released when he took the gen@@ ie , the gen@@ i@@ us out of him where it was caus@@ ing nothing but trouble , and released it back where it came from , and realized that this didn &apos;t have to be this intern@@ alized , tor@@ ment@@ ed thing .
It could be this p@@ ecu@@ li@@ ar , won@@ dr@@ ous , bizarre collaboration , kind of conversation between Tom and the strange , ex@@ tern@@ al thing that was not quite Tom .
When I heard that story , it started to shift a little bit the way that I worked too , and this idea already saved me once .
It saved me when I was in the middle of writing &quot; E@@ at , Pr@@ ay , Lo@@ ve , &quot; and I fell into one of those sort of p@@ its of des@@ pair that we all fall into when we &apos;re working on something and it &apos;s not coming and you start to think this is going to be a disaster , the worst book ever written .
Not just bad , but the worst book ever written .
And I started to think I should just du@@ mp this project .
But then I rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ed Tom talking to the open air and I tried it .
So I just lif@@ ted my face up from the man@@ us@@ cript and I direc@@ ted my comm@@ ents to an empty corner of the room .
And I said al@@ oud , &quot; L@@ isten you , thing , you and I both know that if this book isn &apos;t brilliant that is not entirely my fau@@ lt , right ?
Because you can see that I am putting everything I have into this , I don &apos;t have any more than this .
If you want it to be better , you &apos;ve got to show up and do your part of the deal .
But if you don &apos;t do that , you know what , the hell with it .
I &apos;m going to keep writing anyway because that &apos;s my job .
And I would please like the record to refl@@ ect today that I showed up for my part of the job . &quot;
Because -- Because in the end it &apos;s like this , OK -- centu@@ ries ago in the des@@ er@@ ts of North Africa , people used to ga@@ ther for these mo@@ on@@ light d@@ ances of sac@@ red dance and music that would go on for hours and hours , until d@@ a@@ wn .
They were always magni@@ fic@@ ent , because the d@@ anc@@ ers were professi@@ on@@ als and they were terri@@ fic , right ?
But every once in a while , very rar@@ ely , something would happen , and one of these perform@@ ers would actually become trans@@ cend@@ ent .
And I know you know what I &apos;m talking about , because I know you &apos;ve all seen , at some point in your life , a performance like this .
It was like time would stop , and the d@@ ancer would sort of step through some kind of port@@ al and he wasn &apos;t doing anything different than he had ever done , 1,000 ni@@ ghts before , but everything would al@@ ign .
And all of a sudden , he would no longer appear to be mer@@ ely human .
He would be lit from within , and lit from below and all lit up on fire with div@@ in@@ ity .
And when this happened , back then , people knew it for what it was , you know , they called it by its name .
They would put their hands together and they would start to chant , &quot; Al@@ la@@ h , Al@@ la@@ h , Al@@ la@@ h , God , God , God . &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
Cu@@ ri@@ ous histor@@ ical foot@@ note : when the Mo@@ ors inv@@ aded sou@@ thern S@@ pain , they took this cu@@ st@@ om with them and the pron@@ un@@ ci@@ ation changed over the centu@@ ries from &quot; Al@@ la@@ h , Al@@ la@@ h , Al@@ la@@ h , &quot; to &quot; O@@ l@@ é , ol@@ é , ol@@ é , &quot; which you still hear in bul@@ l@@ fi@@ ghts and in fl@@ am@@ enc@@ o d@@ ances .
In S@@ pain , when a per@@ former has done something impossible and magic , &quot; Al@@ la@@ h , ol@@ é , ol@@ é , Al@@ la@@ h , magni@@ fic@@ ent , br@@ av@@ o , &quot; in@@ com@@ pre@@ hen@@ sible , there it is -- a g@@ lim@@ p@@ se of God .
Which is great , because we need that .
But , the tric@@ ky bit comes the next morning , for the d@@ ancer himself , when he w@@ akes up and disco@@ vers that it &apos;s Tu@@ es@@ day at 11 a@@ .@@ m@@ . , and he &apos;s no longer a g@@ lim@@ p@@ se of God .
He &apos;s just an aging mor@@ tal with really bad k@@ ne@@ es , and maybe he &apos;s never going to as@@ c@@ end to that he@@ ight again .
And maybe nobody will ever chant God &apos;s name again as he sp@@ ins , and what is he then to do with the rest of his life ?
This is hard .
This is one of the most pain@@ ful re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ations to make in a creative life .
But maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be quite so full of angu@@ ish if you never happened to believe , in the first place , that the most extraordinary aspects of your being came from you .
But maybe if you just believed that they were on lo@@ an to you from some un@@ imagin@@ able source for some ex@@ qu@@ is@@ ite por@@ tion of your life to be passed along when you &apos;re finished , with somebody else .
And , you know , if we think about it this way , it starts to change everything .
This is how I &apos;ve started to think , and this is certainly how I &apos;ve been thinking in the last few months as I &apos;ve been working on the book that will soon be published , as the danger@@ ously , fri@@ ghten@@ ingly over@@ -@@ anticip@@ ated follow up to my fre@@ ak@@ ish success .
And what I have to sort of keep telling myself when I get really psy@@ ched out about that is don &apos;t be afraid .
Don &apos;t be dau@@ n@@ ted . Just do your job .
Con@@ tin@@ ue to show up for your piece of it , whatever that might be .
If your job is to dance , do your dance .
If the div@@ ine , co@@ c@@ ke@@ yed gen@@ i@@ us as@@ signed to your case dec@@ ides to let some sort of wonder@@ ment be g@@ lim@@ p@@ sed , for just one moment through your efforts , then &quot; O@@ l@@ é ! &quot;
And if not , do your dance any@@ how .
And &quot; O@@ l@@ é ! &quot; to you , non@@ eth@@ eless .
I believe this and I feel that we must teach it .
&quot; O@@ l@@ é ! &quot; to you , non@@ eth@@ eless , just for having the she@@ er human love and stu@@ b@@ bor@@ n@@ ness to keep showing up .
Thank you .
Thank you .
J@@ une Co@@ h@@ en : O@@ l@@ é !
You know , I &apos;ve talked about some of these projects before -- about the human genome and what that might mean , and disco@@ vering new sets of genes .
We &apos;re actually starting at a new point : we &apos;ve been di@@ gi@@ tiz@@ ing biology , and now we &apos;re trying to go from that digital code into a new phase of biology with designing and syn@@ thes@@ izing life .
So , we &apos;ve always been trying to ask big questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; is something that I think many bio@@ logists have been trying to understand at various levels .
We &apos;ve tried various appro@@ aches , par@@ ing it down to minim@@ al compon@@ ents .
We &apos;ve been di@@ gi@@ tiz@@ ing it now for almost 20 years ; when we se@@ qu@@ enced the human genome , it was going from the analo@@ g world of biology into the digital world of the computer .
Now we &apos;re trying to ask , &quot; Can we re@@ generate life or can we create new life out of this digital universe ? &quot;
This is the map of a small organis@@ m , My@@ co@@ plas@@ ma gen@@ it@@ ali@@ um , that has the small@@ est genome for a species that can self-@@ replic@@ ate in the labor@@ atory , and we &apos;ve been trying to just see if we can come up with an even smaller genome .
We &apos;re able to kno@@ ck out on the order of 100 genes out of the 500 or so that are here .
When we look at its met@@ abo@@ lic map , it &apos;s relatively simple compared to ours -- trust me , this is simple -- but when we look at all the genes that we can kno@@ ck out one at a time , it &apos;s very un@@ likely that this would y@@ i@@ eld a living cell .
So we decided the only way forward was to actually syn@@ thes@@ ize this chromo@@ some so we could v@@ ary the compon@@ ents to ask some of these most fundamental questions .
And so we started down the road of : can we syn@@ thes@@ ize a chromo@@ some ?
Can chemistry per@@ mit making these really large molecules where we &apos;ve never been before ?
And if we do , can we bo@@ ot up a chromo@@ some ?
A chromo@@ some , by the way , is just a piece of in@@ ert chemical material .
So , our p@@ ace of di@@ gi@@ tiz@@ ing life has been increasing at an exponenti@@ al p@@ ace .
Our ability to write the genetic code has been moving pretty slowly but has been increasing , and our lat@@ est point would put it on , now , an exponenti@@ al cur@@ ve .
We started this over 15 years ago .
It took several st@@ ages , in fact , starting with a bio@@ eth@@ ical re@@ view before we did the first experiments .
But it turns out syn@@ thes@@ izing DNA is very difficult .
There are tens of thousands of machines around the world that make small pieces of DNA -- 30 to 50 letters in l@@ ength -- and it &apos;s a de@@ generate process , so the longer you make the piece , the more er@@ r@@ ors there are .
So we had to create a new method for putting these little pieces together and correct all the er@@ r@@ ors .
And this was our first attemp@@ t , starting with the digital information of the genome of ph@@ i X@@ 17@@ 4 .
It &apos;s a small virus that kill@@ s bacteria .
We designed the pieces , went through our er@@ ror correc@@ tion and had a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters .
The exciting phase came when we took this piece of in@@ ert chemical and put it in the bacteria , and the bacteria started to read this genetic code , made the vir@@ al particles .
The vir@@ al particles then were released from the cells and came back and killed the E@@ . col@@ i .
I was talking to the oil industry recently and I said they clearly understood that model .
They laugh@@ ed more than you guys are . And so , we think this is a situation where the software can actually build its own hard@@ ware in a biological system .
But we wanted to go much larger : we wanted to build the entire bacter@@ ial chromo@@ some -- it &apos;s over 5@@ 8@@ 0,000 letters of genetic code -- so we thought we &apos;d build them in cass@@ ettes the size of the viruses so we could actually v@@ ary the cass@@ ettes to understand what the actual compon@@ ents of a living cell are .
Des@@ ign is critical , and if you &apos;re starting with digital information in the computer , that digital information has to be really accur@@ ate .
When we first se@@ qu@@ enced this genome in 199@@ 5 , the standard of accur@@ acy was one er@@ ror per 10,000 base pairs .
We actually found , on res@@ equ@@ encing it , 30 er@@ r@@ ors ; had we used that original sequence , it never would have been able to be bo@@ ot@@ ed up .
Par@@ t of the design is designing pieces that are 50 letters long that have to over@@ la@@ p with all the other 5@@ 0-@@ letter pieces to build smaller sub@@ un@@ its we have to design so they can go together .
We design unique elements into this .
You may have read that we put wat@@ er@@ mar@@ ks in .
Think of this : we have a four@@ -@@ letter genetic code -- A , C , G and T .
T@@ ri@@ pl@@ ets of those letters code for roughly 20 amin@@ o aci@@ ds , such that there &apos;s a single letter design@@ ation for each of the amin@@ o aci@@ ds .
So we can use the genetic code to write out words , sent@@ ences , thoughts .
I@@ ni@@ ti@@ ally , all we did was auto@@ graph it .
Some people were dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted there was not poetry .
We designed these pieces so we can just ch@@ ew back with enz@@ y@@ mes ; there are enz@@ y@@ mes that re@@ pair them and put them together .
And we started making pieces , starting with pieces that were 5,000 to 7@@ ,000 letters , put those together to make 2@@ 4@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ letter pieces , then put sets of those going up to 7@@ 2,000 .
At each stage , we grew up these pieces in ab@@ un@@ dance so we could sequence them because we &apos;re trying to create a process that &apos;s extremely rob@@ ust that you can see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to get to the point of autom@@ ation .
So , this looks like a bas@@ ket@@ ball play@@ off .
When we get into these really large pieces over 100,000 base pairs , they won &apos;t any longer grow read@@ ily in E@@ . col@@ i -- it ex@@ h@@ aus@@ ts all the modern tools of molecular biology -- and so we turned to other mechan@@ is@@ ms .
We knew there &apos;s a mechan@@ ism called hom@@ o@@ log@@ ous re@@ combin@@ ation that biology uses to re@@ pair DNA that can put pieces together .
Here &apos;s an example of it : there &apos;s an organis@@ m called De@@ in@@ o@@ co@@ c@@ c@@ us radi@@ o@@ dur@@ ans that can take three millions ra@@ ds of radiation .
You can see in the top pan@@ el , its chromo@@ some just gets blo@@ wn apart .
Tw@@ el@@ ve to 24 hours later , it put it back together exactly as it was before .
We have thousands of organisms that can do this .
These organisms can be totally des@@ ic@@ c@@ ated ; they can live in a vac@@ u@@ um .
I am absolutely certain that life can exist in ou@@ ter space , move around , find a new aqu@@ e@@ ous environment .
In fact , NASA has shown a lot of this is out there .
Here &apos;s an actual micro@@ graph of the molecule we built using these processes , actually just using y@@ e@@ ast mechan@@ is@@ ms with the right design of the pieces we put them in ; y@@ e@@ ast puts them together autom@@ atically .
This is not an electr@@ on micro@@ graph ; this is just a regular phot@@ om@@ ic@@ ro@@ graph .
It &apos;s such a large molecule we can see it with a light microscope .
These are pictures over about a six@@ -@@ second period .
So , this is the public@@ ation we had just a short while ago .
This is over 5@@ 8@@ 0,000 letters of genetic code ; it &apos;s the largest molecule ever made by humans of a defined structure .
It &apos;s over 300 million molecular weight .
If we prin@@ ted it out at a 10 font with no spac@@ ing , it takes 14@@ 2 pages just to print this genetic code .
Well , how do we bo@@ ot up a chromo@@ some ? How do we activ@@ ate this ?
Ob@@ vi@@ ously , with a virus it &apos;s pretty simple ; it &apos;s much more complicated dealing with bacteria .
It &apos;s also simpl@@ er when you go into eu@@ k@@ ar@@ y@@ otes like ourselves : you can just pop out the nucl@@ eus and pop in another one , and that &apos;s what you &apos;ve all heard about with cl@@ oning .
With bacteria and Ar@@ cha@@ e@@ a , the chromo@@ some is integr@@ ated into the cell , but we recently showed that we can do a complete trans@@ plant of a chromo@@ some from one cell to another and activ@@ ate it .
We pu@@ ri@@ fied a chromo@@ some from one micro@@ bi@@ al species -- roughly , these two are as dis@@ tant as human and mi@@ ce -- we ad@@ ded a few extra genes so we could sel@@ ect for this chromo@@ some , we dig@@ ested it with enz@@ y@@ mes to kill all the prot@@ e@@ ins , and it was pretty stun@@ ning when we put this in the cell -- and you &apos;ll appreci@@ ate our very sophistic@@ ated graph@@ ics here .
The new chromo@@ some went into the cell .
In fact , we thought this might be as far as it went , but we tried to design the process a little bit further .
This is a major mechan@@ ism of evolution right here .
We find all kinds of species that have taken up a second chromo@@ some or a third one from somewhere , ad@@ ding thousands of new traits in a second to that species .
So , people who think of evolution as just one gene changing at a time have miss@@ ed much of biology .
There are enz@@ y@@ mes called restric@@ tion enz@@ y@@ mes that actually dig@@ est DNA .
The chromo@@ some that was in the cell doesn &apos;t have one ; the chromo@@ some we put in does .
It got ex@@ pressed and it recogni@@ zed the other chromo@@ some as foreign material , che@@ wed it up , and so we ended up just with a cell with the new chromo@@ some .
It turned blue because of the genes we put in it .
And with a very short period of time , all the character@@ is@@ tics of one species were lost and it conver@@ ted totally into the new species based on the new software that we put in the cell .
All the prot@@ e@@ ins changed , the mem@@ bran@@ es changed ; when we read the genetic code , it &apos;s exactly what we had trans@@ fer@@ red in .
So , this may sound like gen@@ om@@ ic al@@ chem@@ y , but we can , by moving the software of DNA around , change things quite dram@@ atically .
Now I &apos;ve argu@@ ed , this is not gen@@ es@@ is ; this is building on three and a half billion years of evolution .
And I &apos;ve argu@@ ed that we &apos;re about to perhaps create a new version of the Cam@@ bri@@ an explosion , where there &apos;s massive new speci@@ ation based on this digital design .
Why do this ?
I think this is pretty obvious in terms of some of the needs .
We &apos;re about to go from six and a half to nine billion people over the next 40 years .
To put it in context for myself : I was born in 194@@ 6 .
There are now three people on the planet for every one of us that exis@@ ted in 194@@ 6 ; within 40 years , there &apos;ll be four .
We have trouble fe@@ eding , provi@@ ding fresh , clean water , medic@@ ines , fuel for the six and a half billion .
It &apos;s going to be a stre@@ t@@ ch to do it for nine .
We use over five billion tons of coal , 30 billi@@ on-@@ plus bar@@ rels of oil -- that &apos;s a hundred million bar@@ rels a day .
When we try to think of biological processes or any process to re@@ place that , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenge .
Then of course , there &apos;s all that CO2 from this material that ends up in the atmosphere .
We now , from our discovery around the world , have a dat@@ ab@@ ase with about 20 million genes , and I like to think of these as the design compon@@ ents of the future .
The electron@@ ics industry only had a do@@ zen or so compon@@ ents , and look at the diversity that came out of that .
We &apos;re limited here prim@@ arily by a biological reality and our imagination .
We now have techniques , because of these rap@@ id metho@@ ds of syn@@ thesis , to do what we &apos;re calling combin@@ at@@ ori@@ al gen@@ om@@ ics .
We have the ability now to build a large robot that can make a million chromo@@ som@@ es a day .
When you think of proc@@ essing these 20 million different genes or trying to opti@@ mi@@ ze processes to produce oc@@ t@@ ane or to produce pharmaceu@@ tic@@ als , new vacc@@ ines , we can just with a small team , do more molecular biology than the last 20 years of all science .
And it &apos;s just standard sel@@ ection : we can sel@@ ect for vi@@ ability , chemical or fuel production , vacc@@ ine production , etc .
This is a screen sn@@ ap@@ shot of some true design software that we &apos;re working on to actually be able to sit down and design species in the computer .
You know , we don &apos;t know necessarily what it &apos;ll look like : we know exactly what their genetic code looks like .
We &apos;re foc@@ using on now four@@ th-@@ generation fu@@ els .
You &apos;ve seen recently , cor@@ n to eth@@ an@@ ol is just a bad experiment .
We have second@@ - and thir@@ d-@@ generation fu@@ els that will be coming out relatively soon that are su@@ gar , to much high@@ er-@@ value fu@@ els like oc@@ t@@ ane or different types of bu@@ tan@@ ol .
But the only way we think that biology can have a major impact without further increasing the cost of food and lim@@ iting its avail@@ ability is if we start with CO2 as its feed@@ stock , and so we &apos;re working with designing cells to go down this road .
And we think we &apos;ll have the first four@@ th-@@ generation fu@@ els in about 18 months .
S@@ un@@ light and CO2 is one method ...
but in our discovery around the world , we have all kinds of other metho@@ ds .
This is an organis@@ m we described in 199@@ 6 .
It lives in the deep ocean , about a mile and a half deep , almost at bo@@ il@@ ing-@@ water temper@@ atures .
It takes CO2 to meth@@ ane using molecular hydro@@ gen as its energy source .
We &apos;re looking to see if we can take cap@@ tured CO2 , which can easily be pi@@ ped to sites , con@@ vert that CO2 back into fuel to drive this process .
So , in a short period of time , we think that we might be able to increase what the basic question is of &quot; What is life ? &quot;
We truly , you know , have mod@@ est goals of re@@ plac@@ ing the whole pe@@ tr@@ ol@@ -@@ chemical industry -- Yeah . If you can &apos;t do that at TED , where can you ? -- become a major source of energy ...
But also , we &apos;re now working on using these same tools to come up with instant sets of vacc@@ ines .
You &apos;ve seen this year with flu ; we &apos;re always a year behind and a dollar short when it comes to the right vacc@@ ine .
I think that can be changed by building combin@@ at@@ ori@@ al vacc@@ ines in adv@@ ance .
Here &apos;s what the future may begin to look like with changing , now , the evolutionary tree , spe@@ eding up evolution with syn@@ thetic bacteria , Ar@@ cha@@ e@@ a and , eventually , eu@@ k@@ ar@@ y@@ otes .
We &apos;re a ways away from impro@@ ving people : our goal is just to make sure that we have a chance to survive long enough to maybe do that . Thank you very much .
What I &apos;m going to show you first , as quickly as I can , is some f@@ ound@@ ational work , some new technology that we brought to Microsoft as part of an acqu@@ is@@ ition almost exactly a year ago . This is S@@ ea@@ drag@@ on , and it &apos;s an environment in which you can either loc@@ ally or rem@@ ot@@ ely interact with vast amoun@@ ts of visual data .
We &apos;re looking at many , many gig@@ ab@@ y@@ tes of digital photos here and kind of se@@ am@@ less@@ ly and continu@@ ously zo@@ om@@ ing in , p@@ ann@@ ing through it , re@@ arrang@@ ing it in any way we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how much information we &apos;re looking at , how big these collec@@ tions are or how big the images are .
Most of them are ordinary digital camera photos , but this one , for example , is a s@@ can from the Li@@ br@@ ary of Congr@@ ess , and it &apos;s in the 300 me@@ g@@ ap@@ i@@ x@@ el range .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that ought to lim@@ it the performance of a system like this one is the number of pi@@ x@@ els on your screen at any given moment .
It &apos;s also very flex@@ ible architecture .
This is an entire book , so this is an example of non-@@ image data .
This is &quot; B@@ lea@@ k Hou@@ se &quot; by D@@ ick@@ ens . Every col@@ um@@ n is a chap@@ ter .
To prove to you that it &apos;s really text , and not an image , we can do something like so , to really show that this is a real repres@@ entation of the text ; it &apos;s not a picture .
Maybe this is an artificial way to read an e-@@ book .
I wouldn &apos;t re@@ comm@@ end it .
This is a more re@@ alis@@ tic case , an issue of The Gu@@ ar@@ di@@ an .
Every large image is the beginning of a section .
And this really gives you the joy and the good experience of reading the real paper version of a magazine or a newsp@@ aper , which is an inher@@ ently multi-@@ scale kind of medi@@ um .
We &apos;ve done something with the corner of this particular issue of The Gu@@ ar@@ di@@ an .
We &apos;ve made up a fa@@ ke ad that &apos;s very high resol@@ ution -- much higher than in an ordinary ad -- and we &apos;ve em@@ bed@@ ded extra content .
If you want to see the fe@@ atures of this car , you can see it here .
Or other models , or even technical speci@@ fic@@ ations .
And this really gets at some of these ideas about really doing away with those lim@@ its on screen real est@@ ate .
We hope that this means no more po@@ p@@ -@@ u@@ ps and other ru@@ b@@ b@@ ish like that -- shouldn &apos;t be necessary .
Of course , m@@ apping is one of those obvious applications for a technology like this .
And this one I really won &apos;t spend any time on , except to say that we have things to contribu@@ te to this field as well .
But those are all the ro@@ ads in the U.@@ S .
super@@ im@@ posed on top of a NASA ge@@ o@@ spatial image .
So let &apos;s pull up , now , something else .
This is actually live on the Web now ; you can go check it out .
This is a project called Ph@@ ot@@ o@@ syn@@ th , which mar@@ ries two different technologies .
One of them is S@@ ea@@ drag@@ on and the other is some very beautiful compu@@ ter@@ -@@ vision research done by No@@ ah S@@ nav@@ ely , a graduate student at the University of Washington , co-@@ ad@@ vis@@ ed by Steve Se@@ it@@ z at U.@@ W .
and R@@ ick S@@ z@@ el@@ is@@ ki at Microsoft Res@@ ear@@ ch . A very nice collaboration .
And so this is live on the Web . It &apos;s powered by S@@ ea@@ drag@@ on .
You can see that when we do these sorts of vie@@ ws , where we can di@@ ve through images and have this kind of multi-@@ resol@@ ution experience .
But the spatial arrang@@ ement of the images here is actually meaning@@ ful .
The computer vision algorith@@ ms have reg@@ is@@ tered these images together so that they correspond to the real space in which these sh@@ ots -- all taken near Gr@@ as@@ si La@@ kes in the Can@@ adi@@ an Roc@@ k@@ ies -- all these sh@@ ots were taken . So you see elements here of st@@ ab@@ ili@@ zed sli@@ de-@@ show or pan@@ or@@ am@@ ic imag@@ ing , and these things have all been related spati@@ ally .
I &apos;m not sure if I have time to show you any other environments .
Some are much more spatial .
I would like to jump straight to one of No@@ ah &apos;s original dat@@ a-@@ sets -- this is from an early prototype that we first got working this summer -- to show you what I think is really the p@@ unch line behind the Ph@@ ot@@ o@@ syn@@ th technology , It &apos;s not necessarily so appar@@ ent from looking at the environments we &apos;ve put up on the website .
We had to worry about the law@@ yers and so on .
This is a re@@ construction of N@@ ot@@ re D@@ ame C@@ a@@ the@@ dr@@ al that was done entirely compu@@ t@@ ation@@ ally from images scr@@ ap@@ ed from F@@ lic@@ k@@ r .
You just type N@@ ot@@ re D@@ ame into F@@ lic@@ k@@ r , and you get some pictures of guys in T@@ -@@ shir@@ ts , and of the campus and so on .
And each of these orange con@@ es represents an image that was discovered to bel@@ ong to this model .
And so these are all F@@ lic@@ k@@ r images , and they &apos;ve all been related spati@@ ally in this way .
We can just navig@@ ate in this very simple way .
You know , I never thought that I &apos;d end up working at Microsoft .
It &apos;s very grati@@ fying to have this kind of re@@ ception here .
I guess you can see this is lots of different types of cameras : it &apos;s everything from cell@@ -@@ phone cameras to professional S@@ L@@ R@@ s , quite a large number of them , sti@@ t@@ ched together in this environment .
If I can find some of the sort of weird ones -- So many of them are oc@@ clu@@ ded by faces , and so on .
Some@@ where in here there is actually a series of photograph@@ s -- here we go .
This is actually a pos@@ ter of N@@ ot@@ re D@@ ame that reg@@ is@@ tered correc@@ tly .
We can di@@ ve in from the pos@@ ter to a physical view of this environment .
What the point here really is is that we can do things with the social environment .
This is now taking data from everybody -- from the entire collective memory , visu@@ ally , of what the Earth looks like -- and link all of that together .
Those photos become lin@@ ked , and they make something emerg@@ ent that &apos;s greater than the sum of the parts .
You have a model that emerg@@ es of the entire Earth .
Think of this as the long tail to Steph@@ en L@@ aw@@ ler &apos;s Vir@@ tual Earth work .
And this is something that gro@@ ws in complexity as people use it , and whose benefits become greater to the users as they use it .
Their own photos are getting t@@ ag@@ ged with met@@ a-@@ data that somebody else ent@@ ered .
If somebody bo@@ ther@@ ed to ta@@ g all of these s@@ ain@@ ts and say who they all are , then my photo of N@@ ot@@ re D@@ ame C@@ a@@ the@@ dr@@ al suddenly gets en@@ ri@@ ched with all of that data , and I can use it as an en@@ try point to di@@ ve into that space , into that met@@ a-@@ verse , using everybody else &apos;s photos , and do a kind of a cross@@ -@@ mod@@ al and cross@@ -@@ user social experience that way .
And of course , a b@@ y-@@ product of all of that is immen@@ sely rich virtual models of every interesting part of the Earth , coll@@ ected not just from over@@ head f@@ lights and from satellite images and so on , but from the collective memory .
Thank you so much .
Chris Anderson : Do I understand this right ? What your software is going to allow , is that at some point , really within the next few years , all the pictures that are shared by anyone across the world are going to link together ?
B@@ A@@ A : Yes . What this is really doing is disco@@ vering , creating hyper@@ lin@@ ks , if you will , between images .
It &apos;s doing that based on the content inside the images .
And that gets really exciting when you think about the rich@@ ness of the sem@@ an@@ tic information a lot of images have .
Like when you do a web search for images , you type in ph@@ r@@ ases , and the text on the web page is carrying a lot of information about what that picture is of .
What if that picture lin@@ ks to all of your pictures ?
The amount of sem@@ an@@ tic inter@@ connection and rich@@ ness that comes out of that is really huge .
It &apos;s a classi@@ c network effect .
CA : Tr@@ u@@ ly incredible . Congr@@ at@@ ul@@ ations .
You know , one of the intense plea@@ sures of travel and one of the deli@@ ghts of eth@@ no@@ graphi@@ c research is the opportunity to live am@@ ong@@ st those who have not for@@ gotten the old ways , who still feel their past in the wind , touch it in st@@ ones pol@@ ished by rain , tas@@ te it in the bit@@ ter leaves of plants .
Just to know that J@@ ag@@ u@@ ar sh@@ am@@ ans still journey beyond the Mil@@ ky W@@ ay , or the my@@ ths of the In@@ u@@ it el@@ ders still res@@ on@@ ate with meaning , or that in the H@@ im@@ al@@ ay@@ a , the Bu@@ dd@@ his@@ ts still pur@@ sue the breath of the D@@ har@@ ma , is to really remember the central re@@ vel@@ ation of anthropo@@ logy , and that is the idea that the world in which we live does not exist in some absolute sense , but is just one model of reality ,
the conse@@ quence of one particular set of adap@@ tive choices that our lin@@ e@@ age made , al@@ be@@ it success@@ fully , many generations ago .
And of course , we all share the same adap@@ tive im@@ per@@ atives .
We &apos;re all born . We all bring our children into the world .
We go through initi@@ ation r@@ ites .
We have to deal with the in@@ ex@@ or@@ able separ@@ ation of death , so it shouldn &apos;t surprise us that we all sing , we all dance , we all have art .
But what &apos;s interesting is the unique cad@@ ence of the song , the rhy@@ th@@ m of the dance in every culture .
And whether it is the Pen@@ an in the forests of B@@ or@@ ne@@ o , or the Vo@@ o@@ do@@ o ac@@ ol@@ y@@ tes in Hai@@ ti , or the w@@ arri@@ ors in the K@@ ai@@ su@@ t desert of Nor@@ thern Kenya , the C@@ ur@@ ander@@ o in the mountains of the An@@ des , or a car@@ av@@ an@@ ser@@ ai in the middle of the Sahar@@ a -- this is in@@ cident@@ ally the fellow that I trav@@ eled into the desert with a month ago -- or indeed a y@@ ak her@@ der in the s@@ lo@@ pes of Q@@ om@@ ol@@ ang@@ ma ,
Ever@@ est , the go@@ dd@@ ess mother of the world .
All of these pe@@ op@@ les teach us that there are other ways of being , other ways of thinking , other ways of ori@@ enting yourself in the Earth .
And this is an idea , if you think about it , can only fill you with hope .
Now , together the my@@ ri@@ ad cultures of the world make up a web of spiritu@@ al life and cultural life that envelop@@ s the planet , and is as important to the well-@@ being of the planet as indeed is the biological web of life that you know as a bio@@ sphere .
And you might think of this cultural web of life as being an eth@@ no@@ sphere , and you might define the eth@@ no@@ sphere as being the sum total of all thoughts and dreams , my@@ ths , ideas , inspir@@ ations , intu@@ i@@ tions brought into being by the human imagination since the d@@ a@@ wn of consciousness .
The eth@@ no@@ sphere is humanity &apos;s great leg@@ acy .
It &apos;s the symbo@@ l of all that we are and all that we can be as an as@@ ton@@ ish@@ ingly in@@ qu@@ is@@ itive species .
And just as the bio@@ sphere has been sever@@ ely ero@@ ded , so too is the eth@@ no@@ sphere -- and , if anything , at a far greater rate .
No bio@@ logists , for example , would d@@ are suggest that 50 percent of all species or more have been or are on the br@@ ink of extinction because it simply is not true , and yet that -- the most apo@@ cal@@ y@@ p@@ tic scen@@ ario in the re@@ al@@ m of biological diversity -- scar@@ cel@@ y appro@@ aches what we know to be the most optimis@@ tic scen@@ ario in the re@@ al@@ m of cultural diversity .
And the great indic@@ ator of that , of course , is language loss .
When each of you in this room were born , there were 6@@ ,000 languages spo@@ ken on the planet .
Now , a language is not just a body of voc@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary or a set of gram@@ mati@@ cal rules .
A language is a fl@@ ash of the human spirit .
It &apos;s a vehicle through which the sou@@ l of each particular culture comes into the material world .
Every language is an ol@@ d-@@ growth forest of the mind , a wat@@ er@@ sh@@ ed , a thought , an eco@@ system of spiritu@@ al possibilities .
And of those 6@@ ,000 languages , as we sit here today in Mon@@ ter@@ ey , fully half are no longer being wh@@ is@@ per@@ ed into the ears of children .
They &apos;re no longer being taught to babies , which means , effectively , unless something changes , they &apos;re already dead .
What could be more lon@@ ely than to be envelop@@ ed in silence , to be the last of your people to speak your language , to have no way to pass on the wisdom of the ancest@@ ors or anticip@@ ate the promise of the children ?
And yet , that dre@@ ad@@ ful f@@ ate is indeed the p@@ light of somebody somewhere on Earth roughly every two weeks , because every two weeks , some el@@ der dies and car@@ ries with him into the grave the last sy@@ ll@@ ables of an ancient ton@@ gue .
And I know there &apos;s some of you who say , &quot; Well , wouldn &apos;t it be better , wouldn &apos;t the world be a better place if we all just spoke one language ? &quot; And I say , &quot; Great , let &apos;s make that language Yor@@ u@@ ba . Let &apos;s make it C@@ ant@@ on@@ ese .
Let &apos;s make it Ko@@ g@@ i . &quot;
And you &apos;ll suddenly discover what it would be like to be un@@ able to speak your own language .
And so , what I &apos;d like to do with you today is sort of take you on a journey through the eth@@ no@@ sphere , a bri@@ ef journey through the eth@@ no@@ sphere , to try to begin to give you a sense of what in fact is being lost .
Now , there are many of us who sort of forget that when I say &quot; different ways of being , &quot; I really do mean different ways of being .
Take , for example , this child of a Bar@@ as@@ ana in the Nor@@ th@@ west Amazon , the people of the an@@ ac@@ ond@@ a who believe that my@@ tho@@ log@@ ically they came up the mil@@ k river from the e@@ ast in the bel@@ ly of sac@@ red sn@@ akes .
Now , this is a people who cogni@@ tively do not distin@@ gu@@ ish the color blue from the color green because the can@@ opy of the heav@@ ens is equ@@ ated to the can@@ opy of the forest upon which the people de@@ pend .
They have a curious language and marriage rule which is called &quot; lin@@ gu@@ istic exo@@ gam@@ y : &quot; you must mar@@ ry someone who spea@@ ks a different language .
And this is all ro@@ ot@@ ed in the my@@ tho@@ logical past , yet the curious thing is in these long houses , where there are six or seven languages spo@@ ken because of inter@@ marriage , you never hear anyone prac@@ tic@@ ing a language .
They simply listen and then begin to speak .
Or , one of the most fascinating tri@@ bes I ever lived with , the W@@ a@@ or@@ an@@ i of nor@@ the@@ as@@ tern E@@ cu@@ ad@@ or , an as@@ ton@@ ishing people first cont@@ acted pe@@ ace@@ fully in 195@@ 8 .
In 195@@ 7 , five mis@@ sion@@ aries attemp@@ ted contact and made a critical mis@@ take .
They dro@@ pped from the air 8 x 10 glo@@ ss@@ y photograph@@ s of themselves in what we would say to be friend@@ ly ges@@ tures , for@@ getting that these people of the rain@@ forest had never seen anything two-@@ dimensional in their lives .
They picked up these photograph@@ s from the forest floor , tried to look behind the face to find the form or the figure , found nothing , and conclu@@ ded that these were calling cards from the dev@@ il , so they spe@@ ar@@ ed the five mis@@ sion@@ aries to death .
But the W@@ a@@ or@@ an@@ i didn &apos;t just sp@@ ear out@@ si@@ ders .
They spe@@ ar@@ ed each other .
5@@ 4 percent of their mortality was due to them spe@@ ar@@ ing each other .
We trac@@ ed gene@@ alo@@ gies back eight generations , and we found two inst@@ ances of natural death and when we pres@@ su@@ red the people a little bit about it , they ad@@ mit@@ ted that one of the fel@@ lows had gotten so old that he died getting old , so we spe@@ ar@@ ed him anyway . But at the same time they had a per@@ sp@@ ic@@ aci@@ ous knowledge of the forest that was as@@ ton@@ ishing .
Their hun@@ ters could smell animal ur@@ ine at 40 p@@ aces and tell you what species left it behind .
In the early &apos; 8@@ 0s , I had a really as@@ ton@@ ishing as@@ sign@@ ment when I was asked by my professor at Harvard if I was interested in going down to Hai@@ ti , in@@ fil@@ tr@@ ating the secret societies which were the foundation of Du@@ val@@ ier &apos;s strength and T@@ on@@ ton Mac@@ ou@@ tes , and sec@@ ur@@ ing the pois@@ on used to make z@@ om@@ bi@@ es .
In order to make sense out of sensation , of course , I had to understand something about this remarkable faith of Vo@@ dou@@ n . And Vo@@ o@@ do@@ o is not a black magic cul@@ t .
On the contr@@ ary , it &apos;s a complex metaph@@ ysi@@ cal world@@ view .
It &apos;s interesting .
If I asked you to name the great religi@@ ons of the world , what would you say ?
Chris@@ ti@@ an@@ ity , Islam , Bu@@ dd@@ his@@ m , Ju@@ d@@ ais@@ m , whatever .
There &apos;s always one continent left out , the assu@@ mption being that sub-@@ Sahar@@ an Africa had no religious beli@@ efs . Well , of course , they did and Vo@@ o@@ do@@ o is simply the dis@@ till@@ ation of these very profound religious ideas that came over during the trag@@ ic Di@@ as@@ por@@ a of the sl@@ av@@ ery era .
But , what makes Vo@@ o@@ do@@ o so interesting is that it &apos;s this living relationship between the living and the dead .
So , the living give birth to the spir@@ its .
The spir@@ its can be in@@ vo@@ ked from bene@@ ath the Great W@@ ater , respon@@ ding to the rhy@@ th@@ m of the dance to mom@@ ent@@ arily dis@@ place the sou@@ l of the living , so that for that bri@@ ef sh@@ in@@ ing moment , the ac@@ ol@@ y@@ te becomes the go@@ d .
That &apos;s why the Vo@@ o@@ do@@ o@@ ists like to say that &quot; You white people go to chur@@ ch and speak about God .
We dance in the temp@@ le and become God . &quot;
And because you are poss@@ essed , you are taken by the spirit -- how can you be har@@ med ?
So you see these as@@ ton@@ ishing demonstr@@ ations : Vo@@ o@@ do@@ o ac@@ ol@@ y@@ tes in a state of tr@@ ance hand@@ ling bur@@ ning em@@ bers with imp@@ un@@ ity , a rather as@@ ton@@ ishing demonstr@@ ation of the ability of the mind to affect the body that be@@ ars it when cat@@ aly@@ zed in the state of extreme exc@@ itation .
Now , of all the pe@@ op@@ les that I &apos;ve ever been with , the most extraordinary are the Ko@@ g@@ i of the Si@@ er@@ ra N@@ ev@@ ada de S@@ anta Mar@@ ta in nor@@ thern Col@@ om@@ bia .
D@@ esc@@ end@@ ants of the ancient T@@ air@@ on@@ a civilization which once car@@ p@@ eted the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an co@@ as@@ tal pl@@ ain of Col@@ om@@ bia , in the wake of the con@@ qu@@ est , these people re@@ treated into an isol@@ ated vol@@ can@@ ic mas@@ si@@ f that so@@ ars above the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an co@@ as@@ tal pl@@ ain .
In a bloo@@ d@@ st@@ ained continent , these people alone were never con@@ qu@@ ered by the S@@ pan@@ ish .
To this day , they remain r@@ ul@@ ed by a ritu@@ al pri@@ es@@ th@@ ood but the training for the pri@@ es@@ th@@ ood is rather extraordinary .
The young ac@@ ol@@ y@@ tes are taken away from their families at the age of three and four , se@@ ques@@ tered in a sh@@ ado@@ w@@ y world of dark@@ ness in stone hu@@ ts at the base of gl@@ aci@@ ers for 18 years : two n@@ in@@ e-@@ year peri@@ ods deli@@ ber@@ ately cho@@ sen to m@@ im@@ ic the nine months of g@@ estation they spend in their natural mother &apos;s wom@@ b ; now they are met@@ ap@@ hor@@ ically in the wom@@ b of the great mother .
And for this entire time , they are in@@ cul@@ tur@@ ated into the values of their society , values that ma@@ intain the pro@@ position that their pr@@ ay@@ ers and their pr@@ ay@@ ers alone ma@@ intain the cos@@ mic -- or we might say the eco@@ logical -- balance .
And at the end of this amazing initi@@ ation , one day they &apos;re suddenly taken out and for the first time in their lives , at the age of 18 , they see a sun@@ rise . And in that cry@@ st@@ al moment of awareness of first light as the Sun begins to b@@ a@@ the the s@@ lo@@ pes of the stun@@ n@@ ingly beautiful landscape , suddenly everything they have learned in the abstr@@ act is affir@@ med in stun@@ ning gl@@ ory . And the pri@@ est steps back
and says , &quot; You see ? It &apos;s really as I &apos;ve told you .
It is that beautiful . It is y@@ ours to protect . &quot;
They call themselves the &quot; el@@ der bro@@ thers &quot; and they say we , who are the youn@@ ger bro@@ thers , are the ones responsible for destro@@ ying the world .
Now , this level of intuition becomes very important .
Wh@@ enever we think of indi@@ gen@@ ous people and landscape , we either in@@ vo@@ ke R@@ ou@@ ss@@ eau and the old can@@ ard of the &quot; no@@ ble sav@@ age , &quot; which is an idea rac@@ ist in its simplic@@ ity , or altern@@ atively , we in@@ vo@@ ke Th@@ ore@@ au and say these people are closer to the Earth than we are .
Well , indi@@ gen@@ ous people are ne@@ ither senti@@ mental nor wea@@ k@@ en@@ ed by no@@ st@@ al@@ gi@@ a .
There &apos;s not a lot of room for either in the mal@@ ari@@ al sw@@ am@@ ps of the A@@ sm@@ at or in the ch@@ illing win@@ ds of Ti@@ bet , but they have , n@@ ever@@ th@@ eless , through time and ritu@@ al , for@@ ged a traditional my@@ s@@ tique of the Earth that is based not on the idea of being self-@@ consci@@ ously close to it , but on a far sub@@ t@@ ler intuition : the idea that the Earth itself can only exist
because it is bre@@ ath@@ ed into being by human consciousness .
Now , what does that mean ?
It means that a young kid from the An@@ des who &apos;s raised to believe that that mountain is an A@@ p@@ u spirit that will direct his or her des@@ tiny will be a prof@@ ound@@ ly different human being and have a different relationship to that resource or that place than a young kid from Mon@@ t@@ ana raised to believe that a mountain is a pile of rock ready to be min@@ ed .
Wh@@ e@@ ther it &apos;s the ab@@ ode of a spirit or a pile of ore is ir@@ relevant .
What &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that defin@@ es the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
I was raised in the forests of British Col@@ um@@ bia to believe those forests exis@@ ted to be cut .
That made me a different human being than my friends am@@ ong@@ st the K@@ w@@ ag@@ i@@ ul@@ th who believe that those forests were the ab@@ ode of Hu@@ x@@ wh@@ u@@ k@@ w and the Cro@@ o@@ ked B@@ ea@@ k of He@@ av@@ en and the can@@ ni@@ b@@ al spir@@ its that d@@ well@@ ed at the nor@@ th end of the world , spir@@ its they would have to engage during their H@@ am@@ at@@ sa initi@@ ation .
Now , if you begin to look at the idea that these cultures could create different re@@ alities , you could begin to understand some of their extraordinary disco@@ ver@@ ies . Take this plant here .
It &apos;s a photograph I took in the Nor@@ th@@ west Amazon just last A@@ pr@@ il .
This is ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca , which many of you have heard about , the most powerful psycho@@ active prepar@@ ation of the sh@@ am@@ an &apos;s re@@ per@@ toire .
What makes ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca fascinating is not the she@@ er pharmac@@ o@@ logical potential of this prepar@@ ation , but the el@@ abor@@ ation of it . It &apos;s made really of two different sources : on the one hand , this woo@@ dy li@@ ana which has in it a series of bet@@ a-@@ car@@ b@@ ol@@ ines , har@@ mine , har@@ mal@@ ine , mil@@ dly hallucin@@ o@@ gen@@ ic -- to take the v@@ ine alone is rather to have sort of blue h@@ az@@ y smo@@ ke dri@@ ft across your consciousness -- but it &apos;s mix@@ ed with the leaves of a sh@@ ru@@ b in the coffee family
called P@@ sy@@ cho@@ tri@@ a vi@@ ri@@ dis .
This plant had in it some very powerful tr@@ y@@ p@@ t@@ am@@ ines , very close to brain ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in , di@@ meth@@ yl@@ tr@@ y@@ p@@ t@@ amine , 5@@ -@@ meth@@ oxy@@ di@@ meth@@ yl@@ tr@@ y@@ p@@ t@@ amine .
If you &apos;ve ever seen the Y@@ an@@ om@@ ami blo@@ wing that s@@ nu@@ ff up their no@@ ses , that subst@@ ance they make from a different set of species also cont@@ ains meth@@ oxy@@ di@@ meth@@ yl@@ tr@@ y@@ p@@ t@@ amine .
To have that po@@ w@@ der blo@@ wn up your no@@ se is rather like being shot out of a ri@@ f@@ le bar@@ rel lin@@ ed with bar@@ o@@ que pain@@ t@@ ings and l@@ anding on a sea of electricity . It doesn &apos;t create the dist@@ or@@ tion of reality ; it creates the dis@@ solution of reality .
In fact , I used to argue with my professor , Richard E@@ van Sh@@ ul@@ tes -- who is a man who s@@ par@@ ked the psych@@ ed@@ el@@ ic era with his discovery of the magic mus@@ h@@ rooms in Mexico in the 19@@ 3@@ 0s -- I used to argue that you couldn &apos;t classi@@ fy these tr@@ y@@ p@@ t@@ am@@ ines as hallucin@@ o@@ gen@@ ic because by the time you &apos;re under the effects there &apos;s no one home anymore to experience a hallucin@@ ation . But the thing about tr@@ y@@ p@@ t@@ am@@ ines is they cannot be taken or@@ ally
because they &apos;re den@@ atu@@ red by an enz@@ y@@ me found natur@@ ally in the human g@@ ut called mon@@ o@@ amine ox@@ id@@ ase .
They can only be taken or@@ ally if taken in con@@ jun@@ ction with some other chemical that den@@ atures the M@@ A@@ O .
Now , the fascinating things are that the bet@@ a-@@ car@@ b@@ ol@@ ines found within that li@@ ana are M@@ A@@ O in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors of the pre@@ c@@ ise sort necessary to potenti@@ ate the tr@@ y@@ p@@ t@@ amine . So you ask yourself a question .
How , in a fl@@ or@@ a of 8@@ 0,000 species of vas@@ cul@@ ar plants , do these people find these two mor@@ pho@@ log@@ ically un@@ related plants that when combin@@ ed in this way , created a kind of bio@@ chemical version of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts ?
Well , we use that great eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism , &quot; trial and er@@ ror , &quot; which is ex@@ posed to be meaning@@ less .
But you ask the Indi@@ ans , and they say , &quot; The plants talk to us . &quot;
Well , what does that mean ?
This tri@@ be , the C@@ of@@ an , has 17 vari@@ eties of ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca , all of which they distin@@ gu@@ ish a great distance in the forest , all of which are refer@@ able to our eye as one species .
And then you ask them how they establ@@ ish their tax@@ onom@@ y and they say , &quot; I thought you knew something about plants .
I mean , don &apos;t you know anything ? &quot; And I said , &quot; No . &quot;
Well , it turns out you take each of the 17 vari@@ eties in the night of a full moon , and it s@@ ings to you in a different key .
Now , that &apos;s not going to get you a Ph@@ .@@ D@@ . at Harvard , but it &apos;s a lot more interesting than coun@@ ting st@@ am@@ ens . Now -- -- the problem -- the problem is that even those of us symp@@ a@@ thetic with the p@@ light of indi@@ gen@@ ous people view them as qu@@ aint and color@@ ful but somehow re@@ duced to the mar@@ g@@ ins of history as the real world , meaning our world , moves on .
Well , the truth is the 20th century , 300 years from now , is not going to be rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ed for its w@@ ars or its techno@@ logical innovations , but rather as the era in which we stood by and either activ@@ ely end@@ ors@@ ed or pas@@ sively accep@@ ted the massive destruction of both biological and cultural diversity on the planet . Now , the problem isn &apos;t change .
All cultures through all time have constantly been engaged in a dance with new possibilities of life .
And the problem is not technology itself .
The Si@@ ou@@ x Indi@@ ans did not stop being Si@@ ou@@ x when they gave up the b@@ ow and ar@@ row any more than an American stopped being an American when he gave up the hor@@ se and bu@@ gg@@ y .
It &apos;s not change or technology that threat@@ ens the integr@@ ity of the eth@@ no@@ sphere . It is power , the cru@@ de face of domin@@ ation .
Wh@@ er@@ ever you look around the world , you discover that these are not cultures destin@@ ed to fa@@ de away ; these are dynamic living pe@@ op@@ les being driven out of existence by identi@@ fi@@ able forces that are beyond their capacity to adap@@ t to : whether it &apos;s the e@@ gre@@ gi@@ ous de@@ forestation in the hom@@ el@@ and of the Pen@@ an -- a nom@@ adi@@ c people from Sou@@ the@@ ast Asia , from Sar@@ aw@@ ak -- a people who lived free in the forest until a generation ago ,
and now have all been re@@ duced to serv@@ itude and prostitu@@ tion on the ban@@ ks of the ri@@ vers , where you can see the river itself is so@@ il@@ ed with the sil@@ t that seems to be carrying half of B@@ or@@ ne@@ o away to the South China Se@@ a , where the Japanese fre@@ igh@@ ters han@@ g light in the horiz@@ on ready to fill their hol@@ ds with ra@@ w lo@@ gs ri@@ pped from the forest -- or , in the case of the Y@@ an@@ om@@ ami ,
it &apos;s the disease enti@@ ties that have come in , in the wake of the discovery of gold .
Or if we go into the mountains of Ti@@ bet , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research recently , you &apos;ll see it &apos;s a cru@@ de face of political domin@@ ation .
You know , gen@@ o@@ cide , the physical extinction of a people is univers@@ ally con@@ dem@@ ned , but eth@@ no@@ cide , the destruction of people &apos;s way of life , is not only not con@@ dem@@ ned , it &apos;s univers@@ ally , in many quar@@ ters , celebr@@ ated as part of a development strategy .
And you cannot understand the pain of Ti@@ bet until you move through it at the ground level .
I once trav@@ ell@@ ed 6@@ ,000 miles from Ch@@ eng@@ du in Western China over@@ land through sou@@ the@@ as@@ tern Ti@@ bet to L@@ has@@ a with a young colle@@ ague , and it was only when I got to L@@ has@@ a that I understood the face behind the statistics you hear about : 6@@ ,000 sac@@ red mon@@ u@@ ments tor@@ n apart to d@@ ust and ash@@ es , 1.@@ 2 million people killed by the cad@@ res during the C@@ ul@@ tural R@@ evolution .
This young man &apos;s father had been as@@ cri@@ bed to the Pan@@ ch@@ en L@@ ama .
That meant he was inst@@ antly killed at the time of the Chinese invas@@ ion .
His un@@ cle fl@@ ed with His H@@ ol@@ iness in the Di@@ as@@ por@@ a that took the people to Ne@@ p@@ al .
His mother was incar@@ cer@@ ated for the crime of being we@@ al@@ thy .
He was s@@ mu@@ ggl@@ ed into the j@@ ail at the age of two to hide bene@@ ath her sk@@ ir@@ t t@@ ails because she couldn &apos;t bear to be without him .
The sister who had done that br@@ ave deed was put into an education camp .
One day she in@@ adver@@ t@@ ently ste@@ pped on an arm@@ band of Ma@@ o , and for that trans@@ gr@@ ession , she was given seven years of hard labor .
The pain of Ti@@ bet can be impossible to bear , but the red@@ emp@@ tive spirit of the people is something to beh@@ old .
And in the end , then , it really comes down to a choice : do we want to live in a mon@@ o@@ chrom@@ atic world of mon@@ ot@@ ony or do we want to embr@@ ace a poly@@ chrom@@ atic world of diversity ?
Mar@@ gar@@ et M@@ ead , the great anthropo@@ logist , said , before she died , that her greatest fear was that as we dri@@ f@@ ted towards this bl@@ and@@ ly am@@ orph@@ ous gener@@ ic world view not only would we see the entire range of the human imagination re@@ duced to a more nar@@ row mod@@ ality of thought , but that we would wake from a dream one day having for@@ gotten there were even other possibilities .
And it &apos;s hum@@ bling to remember that our species has , perhaps , been around for &#91; 15@@ 0,000 &#93; years .
The Ne@@ oli@@ th@@ ic R@@ evolution -- which gave us agriculture , at which time we suc@@ cu@@ m@@ bed to the cul@@ t of the se@@ ed ; the poetry of the sh@@ am@@ an was dis@@ placed by the pro@@ se of the pri@@ es@@ th@@ ood ; we created hi@@ er@@ arch@@ y speci@@ alization sur@@ plus -- is only 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrial world as we know it is bar@@ ely 300 years old .
Now , that sh@@ allow history doesn &apos;t suggest to me that we have all the answers for all of the challenges that will con@@ front us in the en@@ su@@ ing mill@@ en@@ nia .
When these my@@ ri@@ ad cultures of the world are asked the meaning of being human , they respond with 10,000 different voices .
And it &apos;s within that song that we will all re@@ discover the possibility of being what we are : a fully conscious species , fully aware of en@@ suring that all pe@@ op@@ les and all gard@@ ens find a way to fl@@ our@@ ish . And there are great moments of optimis@@ m .
This is a photograph I took at the nor@@ thern ti@@ p of B@@ aff@@ in Island when I went nar@@ wh@@ al hun@@ ting with some In@@ u@@ it people , and this man , O@@ lay@@ u@@ k , told me a mar@@ vel@@ ous story of his grand@@ father .
The Can@@ adi@@ an government has not always been kind to the In@@ u@@ it people , and during the 195@@ 0s , to establ@@ ish our so@@ ver@@ e@@ ign@@ ty , we forced them into sett@@ l@@ ements .
This old man &apos;s grand@@ father ref@@ used to go .
The family , f@@ ear@@ ful for his life , took away all of his weapons , all of his tools .
Now , you must understand that the In@@ u@@ it did not fear the cold ; they took advantage of it .
The run@@ ners of their sle@@ ds were origin@@ ally made of fish wr@@ apped in car@@ i@@ b@@ ou hide .
So , this man &apos;s grand@@ father was not in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ated by the Ar@@ c@@ tic night or the bli@@ zz@@ ard that was blo@@ wing .
He simply sli@@ pped outside , pul@@ led down his se@@ al@@ skin trou@@ s@@ ers and def@@ ec@@ ated into his hand . And as the f@@ eces began to free@@ ze , he shap@@ ed it into the form of a bl@@ ade .
He put a spr@@ ay of sal@@ iv@@ a on the edge of the sh@@ it k@@ ni@@ fe and as it finally fro@@ ze soli@@ d , he but@@ cher@@ ed a dog with it .
He sk@@ in@@ ned the dog and improvis@@ ed a har@@ ness , took the ri@@ b@@ c@@ age of the dog and improvis@@ ed a s@@ led , har@@ n@@ essed up an ad@@ jac@@ ent dog , and dis@@ appeared over the ice flo@@ es , sh@@ it k@@ ni@@ fe in bel@@ t .
Talk about getting by with nothing . And this , in many ways -- -- is a symbo@@ l of the res@@ ili@@ ence of the In@@ u@@ it people and of all indi@@ gen@@ ous people around the world .
The Can@@ adi@@ an government in A@@ pr@@ il of 199@@ 9 gave back to total control of the In@@ u@@ it an area of land larger than California and Texas put together .
It &apos;s our new hom@@ el@@ and . It &apos;s called N@@ un@@ av@@ ut .
It &apos;s an independent territ@@ ory . They control all min@@ eral resources .
An amazing example of how a nation@@ -@@ state can see@@ k res@@ ti@@ tu@@ tion with its people .
And finally , in the end , I think it &apos;s pretty obvious at least to all of all us who &apos;ve trav@@ eled in these remote re@@ aches of the planet , to realize that they &apos;re not remote at all .
They &apos;re hom@@ el@@ ands of somebody .
They represent bran@@ ches of the human imagination that go back to the d@@ a@@ wn of time . And for all of us , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our own children , become part of the n@@ a@@ ked ge@@ ograph@@ y of hope .
So , what we &apos;re trying to do at the National Ge@@ ographic , finally , is , we believe that politicians will never accompl@@ ish anything .
We think that pol@@ em@@ ics -- -- we think that pol@@ em@@ ics are not persu@@ as@@ ive , but we think that stor@@ y@@ telling can change the world , and so we are probably the best stor@@ y@@ telling institution in the world . We get 35 million h@@ its on our website every month .
15@@ 6 nations carry our television chan@@ nel .
Our magaz@@ ines are read by millions .
And what we &apos;re doing is a series of jour@@ ne@@ ys to the eth@@ no@@ sphere where we &apos;re going to take our audience to places of such cultural wonder that they cannot help but come away d@@ az@@ z@@ led by what they have seen , and hopefully , therefore , embr@@ ace gradu@@ ally , one by one , the central re@@ vel@@ ation of anthropo@@ logy : that this world des@@ er@@ ves to exist in a di@@ verse way , that we can find a way to live in a truly multi@@ cultural , pl@@ ur@@ alis@@ tic world
where all of the wisdom of all pe@@ op@@ les can contribu@@ te to our collective well-@@ being .
Thank you very much .
I &apos;m going to talk to you about some stuff that &apos;s in this book of mine that I hope will res@@ on@@ ate with other things you &apos;ve already heard , and I &apos;ll try to make some connections myself , in case you miss@@ ed them .
But I want to start with what I call the &quot; offici@@ al do@@ g@@ ma . &quot;
The offici@@ al do@@ g@@ ma of what ?
The offici@@ al do@@ g@@ ma of all Western industrial societies .
And the offici@@ al do@@ g@@ ma r@@ uns like this : if we are interested in maxim@@ izing the wel@@ f@@ are of our citizens , the way to do that is to maxim@@ ize individual freedom .
The reason for this is both that freedom is in and of itself good , valuable , wor@@ th@@ while , essential to being human .
And because if people have freedom , then each of us can act on our own to do the things that will maxim@@ ize our wel@@ f@@ are , and no one has to decide on our be@@ half .
The way to maxim@@ ize freedom is to maxim@@ ize choice .
The more choice people have , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom they have , the more wel@@ f@@ are they have .
This , I think , is so deeply em@@ bed@@ ded in the water supply that it wouldn &apos;t occu@@ r to anyone to question it .
And it &apos;s also deeply em@@ bed@@ ded in our lives .
I &apos;ll give you some examples of what modern progress has made possible for us .
This is my super@@ market . Not such a big one .
I want to say just a word about sal@@ ad dr@@ essing .
1@@ 75 sal@@ ad dr@@ ess@@ ings in my super@@ market , if you don &apos;t count the 10 extra@@ -@@ vir@@ g@@ in o@@ live o@@ ils and 12 bal@@ sam@@ ic v@@ ine@@ gars you could buy to make a very large number of your own sal@@ ad dr@@ ess@@ ings , in the off@@ -@@ chance that none of the 1@@ 75 the store has on offer suit you .
So this is what the super@@ market is like .
And then you go to the consu@@ mer electron@@ ics store to set up a st@@ ere@@ o system -- spea@@ kers , C@@ D player , tape player , tu@@ ner , am@@ pli@@ fier -- and in this one single consu@@ mer electron@@ ics store , there are that many st@@ ere@@ o systems .
We can construc@@ t six@@ -@@ and-@@ a-@@ hal@@ f-@@ million different st@@ ere@@ o systems out of the compon@@ ents that are on offer in one store .
You &apos;ve got to ad@@ mit that &apos;s a lot of choice .
In other dom@@ ains -- the world of communications .
There was a time , when I was a boy , when you could get any kind of tele@@ phone service you wanted , as long as it came from Ma B@@ ell .
You r@@ ented your phone . You didn &apos;t buy it .
One conse@@ quence of that , by the way , is that the phone never broke .
And those days are gone .
We now have an almost un@@ limited variety of phones , especially in the world of cell phones .
These are cell phones of the future .
My favorite is the middle one -- the M@@ P@@ 3 player , no@@ se hair tr@@ im@@ mer , and cr@@ è@@ me br@@ û@@ l@@ é@@ e tor@@ ch .
And if by some chance you haven &apos;t seen that in your store yet , you can rest assu@@ red that one day soon , you will .
And what this does is it leads people to walk into their stor@@ es asking this question .
And do you know what the answer to this question now is ?
The answer is &quot; no . &quot;
It is not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more significant than buying things , the same explosion of choice is true .
Health care . It is no longer the case in the United States that you go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you what to do .
Instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you , &quot; Well , we could do A , or we could do B .
A has these benefits , and these risks .
B has these benefits , and these risks . What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; Do@@ c , what should I do ? &quot;
And the do@@ c says , &quot; A has these benefits and risks , and B has these benefits and risks .
What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; If you were me , Do@@ c , what would you do ? &quot;
And the do@@ c says , &quot; But I &apos;m not you . &quot;
And the result is -- we call it &quot; patient autonom@@ y , &quot; which makes it sound like a good thing , but it really is a shif@@ ting of the bur@@ den and the responsibility for dec@@ isi@@ on-@@ making from somebody who knows something -- nam@@ ely , the doctor -- to somebody who knows nothing and is almost certainly sick and th@@ us not in the best shape to be making decisions -- nam@@ ely , the patient .
There &apos;s enormous marketing of pres@@ cri@@ ption drugs to people like you and me , which , if you think about it , makes no sense at all , since we can &apos;t buy them .
Why do they market to us if we can &apos;t buy them ?
The answer is that they expect us to call our doctors the next morning and ask for our pres@@ crip@@ tions to be changed .
Some@@ thing as dram@@ atic as our identity has now become a matter of choice , as this slide is meant to indic@@ ate .
We don &apos;t inher@@ it an identity ; we get to invent it .
And we get to re-@@ invent ourselves as often as we like .
And that means that every day , when you wake up in the morning , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be .
With respect to marriage and family , there was a time when the de@@ fau@@ lt assu@@ mption that almost everyone had is that you got married as soon as you could , and then you started having kids as soon as you could .
The only real choice was who , not when , and not what you did after .
No@@ w@@ ad@@ ays , everything is very much up for gr@@ ab@@ s .
I teach wonder@@ fully intelligent students , and I as@@ sign 20 percent less work than I used to .
And it &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , and it &apos;s not because they &apos;re less di@@ lig@@ ent .
It &apos;s because they are pre@@ occu@@ pied , asking themselves , &quot; Sh@@ ould I get married or not ? Sh@@ ould I get married now ?
Sh@@ ould I get married later ? Sh@@ ould I have kids first , or a career first ? &quot;
All of these are consum@@ ing questions .
And they &apos;re going to answer these questions , whether or not it means not doing all the work I as@@ sign And indeed they should .
These are important questions to answer .
Wor@@ k -- we are bl@@ essed , as Car@@ l was poin@@ ting out , with the technology that en@@ ables us to work every minute of every day from any place on the planet -- except the R@@ and@@ ol@@ p@@ h H@@ ot@@ el .
There is one corner , by the way , that I &apos;m not going to tell anybody about , where the Wi@@ F@@ i actually works .
I &apos;m not telling you about it because I want to use it .
this incredible freedom of choice we have with respect to work , is that we have to make a decision , again and again and again , about whether we should or shouldn &apos;t be working .
We can go to watch our kid play so@@ c@@ cer , and we have our cell phone on one hi@@ p , and our Bl@@ ack@@ ber@@ ry on our other hi@@ p , and our lap@@ top , pres@@ um@@ ably , on our l@@ aps .
And even if they &apos;re all sh@@ ut off , every minute that we &apos;re watching our kid mu@@ til@@ ate a so@@ c@@ cer game , we are also asking ourselves , &quot; Sh@@ ould I answer this cell phone call ?
Sh@@ ould I respond to this email ? Sh@@ ould I dr@@ aft this letter ? &quot;
And even if the answer to the question is &quot; no , &quot; it &apos;s certainly going to make the experience of your kid &apos;s so@@ c@@ cer game very different than it would &apos;ve been .
So everywhere we look , big things and small things , material things and li@@ fes@@ ty@@ le things , life is a matter of choice .
And the world we used to live in looked like this .
That is to say , there were some choices , but not everything was a matter of choice .
And the world we now live in looks like this .
And the question is , is this good news , or bad news ?
And the answer is , &quot; yes . &quot;
We all know what &apos;s good about it , so I &apos;m going to talk about what &apos;s bad about it .
All of this choice has two effects , two negative effects on people .
One effect , parado@@ x@@ ically , is that it produ@@ ces paraly@@ sis , rather than liber@@ ation .
With so many options to choose from , people find it very difficult to choose at all .
I &apos;ll give you one very dram@@ atic example of this : a study that was done of invest@@ ments in volun@@ t@@ ary reti@@ rement plans .
A colle@@ ague of mine got access to investment records from V@@ angu@@ ard , the gi@@ gan@@ tic mu@@ tu@@ al-@@ fu@@ nd company of about a million employ@@ ees and about 2,000 different work@@ places .
And what she found is that for every 10 mu@@ tual fun@@ ds the employ@@ er off@@ ered , rate of participation went down two percent .
You offer 50 fun@@ ds -- 10 percent fe@@ wer employ@@ ees particip@@ ate than if you only offer five . Why ?
Because with 50 fun@@ ds to choose from , it &apos;s so dam@@ n hard to decide which fu@@ nd to choose , that you &apos;ll just put it off until tomorrow .
And then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and of course tomorrow never comes .
Un@@ der@@ stand that not only does this mean that people are going to have to eat dog food when they reti@@ re because they don &apos;t have enough money put away , it also means that making the decision is so hard that they pass up significant mat@@ ching money from the employ@@ er .
By not particip@@ ating , they are pass@@ ing up as much as 5,000 dollars a year from the employ@@ er , who would happ@@ ily match their contribu@@ tion .
So paraly@@ sis is a conse@@ quence of having too many choices .
And I think it makes the world look like this .
You really want to get the decision right if it &apos;s for all et@@ ern@@ ity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to pick the wrong mu@@ tual fu@@ nd , or the wrong sal@@ ad dr@@ essing .
So that &apos;s one effect . The second effect is that even if we manage to over@@ come the paraly@@ sis and make a choice , than we would be if we had fe@@ wer options to choose from .
And there are several reasons for this .
is that with a lot of different sal@@ ad dr@@ ess@@ ings to choose from , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and what sal@@ ad dr@@ essing is ? -- it &apos;s easy to imagine you could have made a different choice that would have been better .
is this imagin@@ ed alternative in@@ du@@ ces you to regre@@ t the decision you made , and this regre@@ t sub@@ tr@@ acts from the satis@@ fac@@ tion you get out of the decision you made , even if it was a good decision .
The more options there are , the easier it is to regre@@ t anything at all that is dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting about the option that you chose .
Second , what econom@@ ists call &quot; opportunity costs . &quot;
Dan G@@ il@@ bert made a big point this morning of talking about how much the way in which we value things depends on what we compare them to .
Well , when there are lots of altern@@ atives to consider , it is easy to imagine the attr@@ active fe@@ atures of altern@@ atives that you rej@@ ect that make you less satis@@ fied with the alternative that you &apos;ve cho@@ sen .
Here &apos;s an example . &#91; I can &apos;t stop thinking about those other available parking spaces on W 8@@ 5@@ th street &#93; S@@ or@@ ry if you &apos;re not New Yor@@ kers .
Here &apos;s what you &apos;re supposed to be thinking .
Here &apos;s this couple on the H@@ am@@ p@@ tons .
Very expensive real est@@ ate .
G@@ or@@ ge@@ ous be@@ ach . Beau@@ ti@@ ful day . They have it all to themselves .
What could be better ? &quot; Well , dam@@ n it , &quot; this guy is thinking , &quot; It &apos;s Au@@ g@@ ust . Everybody in my Manhattan neighborhood is away .
I could be parking right in front of my building . &quot;
And he sp@@ ends two weeks n@@ ag@@ ged by the idea that he is missing the opportunity , day after day , to have a great parking space . O@@ p@@ por@@ tun@@ ity costs sub@@ tr@@ act from the satis@@ fac@@ tion we get out of what we choose , even when what we choose is terri@@ fic .
And the more options there are to consider , the more attr@@ active fe@@ atures of these options are going to be refl@@ ected by us as opportunity costs .
Here &apos;s another example .
Now this carto@@ on makes a lot of points .
It makes points about living in the moment as well , and probably about doing things slowly .
is that whenever you &apos;re cho@@ os@@ ing one thing , you &apos;re cho@@ os@@ ing not to do other things that may have lots of attr@@ active fe@@ atures , and it &apos;s going to make what you &apos;re doing less attr@@ active .
Th@@ ird : es@@ cal@@ ation of expect@@ ations .
This hit me when I went to re@@ place my je@@ ans .
I wear je@@ ans almost all the time .
There was a time when je@@ ans came in one fl@@ av@@ or , and you bought them , and they fit like cr@@ ap , they were incredibly un@@ comfortable , if you w@@ ore them and wash@@ ed them enough times , they started to feel OK .
I went to re@@ place my je@@ ans after years of wearing these old ones , and I said , &quot; I want a pair of je@@ ans . Here &apos;s my size . &quot;
And the sh@@ op@@ kee@@ per said , &quot; Do you want sli@@ m fit , easy fit , rel@@ ax@@ ed fit ?
You want but@@ ton fly or z@@ i@@ p@@ per fly ? You want st@@ on@@ e@@ wash@@ ed or ac@@ id@@ -@@ wash@@ ed ?
Do you want them distr@@ essed ?
You want bo@@ ot cut , tap@@ ered , bl@@ ah bl@@ ah . &quot; On and on he went .
My ja@@ w dro@@ pped . And after I re@@ covered , I said , &quot; I want the kind that used to be the only kind . &quot;
He had no idea what that was , so I spent an hour trying on all these dam@@ n je@@ ans , and I walked out of the store -- truth ! -- with the bes@@ t-@@ f@@ itting je@@ ans I had ever had . I did better .
All this choice made it possible for me to do better .
But -- I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to try to explain this to myself .
The reason I felt worse is that , with all of these options available , my expect@@ ations about how good a pair of je@@ ans should be went up .
I had very low , no particular expect@@ ations when they only came in one fl@@ av@@ or .
When they came in 100 fl@@ av@@ ors , dam@@ n it , one of them should &apos;ve been perfect .
And what I got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
And so I compared what I got to what I expected , and what I got was dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting in compar@@ ison to what I expected .
Ad@@ ding options to people &apos;s lives can &apos;t help but increase the expect@@ ations people have about how good those options will be .
And what that &apos;s going to produce is less satis@@ fac@@ tion with results , even when they &apos;re good results .
No@@ body in the world of marketing knows this .
Because if they did , you wouldn &apos;t all know what this was about .
The truth is more like this .
&#91; Everything was better back when everything was worse &#93; The reason that everything was better back when everything was worse is that when everything was worse , it was actually possible for people to have experiences that were a pl@@ eas@@ ant surprise .
No@@ w@@ ad@@ ays , the world we live in -- we aff@@ lu@@ ent , industri@@ alized citizens , with perf@@ ection the expect@@ ation -- the best you can ever hope for is that stuff is as good as you expect it to be .
You will never be pl@@ eas@@ antly surprised because your expect@@ ations , my expect@@ ations , have gone through the ro@@ of .
The secret to happiness -- this is what you all came for -- the secret to happiness is low expect@@ ations .
I want to say -- just a little auto@@ bio@@ graph@@ ical moment -- that I actually am married to a wife , and she &apos;s really quite wonderful .
I couldn &apos;t have done better . I didn &apos;t set@@ tle .
But sett@@ ling isn &apos;t always such a bad thing .
Fin@@ ally -- One conse@@ quence of buying a bad@@ -@@ f@@ itting pair of je@@ ans when there is only one kind to buy is that when you are dis@@ satis@@ fied , and you ask why , who &apos;s responsible , the answer is clear : the world is responsible .
What could you do ?
When there are hundreds of different sty@@ les of je@@ ans available , and you buy one that is dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting , and you ask why , who &apos;s responsible ?
It is equ@@ ally clear that the answer to the question is &quot; you . &quot;
You could have done better .
With a hundred different kinds of je@@ ans on dis@@ play , there is no ex@@ cu@@ se for failure .
And so when people make decisions , and even though the results of the decisions are good , they feel dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted about them ; they bl@@ ame themselves .
C@@ lin@@ ical depression has explo@@ ded in the industrial world in the last generation .
I believe a significant -- not the only , but a significant -- contribu@@ tor to this explosion of depression , and also suicide , is that people have experiences that are dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting because their standards are so high , and then when they have to explain these experiences to themselves , they think they &apos;re at fau@@ lt .
And so the net result is that we do better in general , objec@@ tively , and we feel worse .
So let me re@@ mind you .
This is the offici@@ al do@@ g@@ ma , the one that we all take to be true , and it &apos;s all fal@@ se .
It is not true . There &apos;s no question that some choice is better than none , but it doesn &apos;t follow from that that more choice is better than some choice .
There &apos;s some mag@@ ical amount . I don &apos;t know what it is .
I &apos;m pretty confi@@ dent that we have long since passed the point where options improve our wel@@ f@@ are .
Now , as a policy matter -- I &apos;m almost done -- as a policy matter , the thing to think about is this : what en@@ ables all of this choice in industrial societies is material aff@@ lu@@ ence .
There are lots of places in the world , and we have heard about several of them , where their problem is not that they have too much choice .
Their problem is that they have too little .
So the stuff I &apos;m talking about is the p@@ ecu@@ li@@ ar problem of modern , aff@@ lu@@ ent , Western societies .
And what is so frustr@@ ating and in@@ fu@@ ri@@ ating is this : Steve L@@ ev@@ it@@ t talked to you yesterday about how these expensive and difficul@@ t-@@ to-@@ inst@@ all child se@@ ats don &apos;t help . It &apos;s a waste of money .
What I &apos;m telling you is that these expensive , complicated choices -- it &apos;s not simply that they don &apos;t help .
They actually hur@@ t .
They actually make us worse off . If some of what en@@ ables people in our societies to make all of the choices we make were shif@@ ted to societies in which people have too few options , not only would those people &apos;s lives be impro@@ ved , but ours would be impro@@ ved also , which is what econom@@ ists call a &quot; Par@@ et@@ o-@@ impro@@ ving move . &quot;
In@@ come re@@ distribution will make everyone better off -- because of how all this exc@@ ess choice pl@@ agues us .
So to conclu@@ de . &#91; You can be anything you want to be -- no lim@@ its &#93; You &apos;re supposed to read this carto@@ on , and , being a sophistic@@ ated person , say , &quot; Ah ! What does this fish know ?
You know , nothing is possible in this fish@@ bo@@ w@@ l . &quot;
Im@@ pover@@ ished imagination , a my@@ op@@ ic view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way I read it at first .
The more I thought about it , how@@ ever , the more I came to the view that this fish knows something .
Because the truth of the matter is that if you sh@@ at@@ ter the fish@@ bo@@ w@@ l so that everything is possible , you don &apos;t have freedom .
You have paraly@@ sis .
If you sh@@ at@@ ter this fish@@ bo@@ w@@ l so that everything is possible , you dec@@ re@@ ase satis@@ fac@@ tion .
You increase paraly@@ sis , and you dec@@ re@@ ase satis@@ fac@@ tion .
Everybody needs a fish@@ bo@@ w@@ l .
This one is almost certainly too limited -- perhaps even for the fish , certainly for us .
But the absence of some met@@ ap@@ hor@@ ical fish@@ bo@@ w@@ l is a reci@@ pe for mis@@ ery , and , I susp@@ ect , disaster .
Thank you very much .
S@@ ever@@ al years ago here at TED , Peter S@@ kill@@ man introduced a design challenge called the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challenge .
And the idea &apos;s pretty simple : T@@ e@@ ams of four have to build the t@@ all@@ est fre@@ e-@@ standing structure out of 20 stic@@ ks of sp@@ ag@@ h@@ et@@ ti , one y@@ ard of tape , one y@@ ard of str@@ ing and a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low .
The mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low has to be on top .
And , though it seems really simple , it &apos;s actually pretty hard because it forces people to collabor@@ ate very quickly .
And so , I thought this was an interesting idea , and I in@@ corpor@@ ated it into a design work@@ shop .
And it was a huge success .
And since then , I &apos;ve conduc@@ ted about 70 design work@@ sh@@ ops across the world with students and designers and archit@@ ects , even the C@@ T@@ O@@ s of the For@@ tune 50 , and there &apos;s something about this exercise that reve@@ als very deep lessons about the nature of collaboration , and I &apos;d like to share some of them with you .
So , normally , most people begin by ori@@ enting themselves to the task .
They talk about it , they figure out what it &apos;s going to look like , they j@@ oc@@ key for power .
Then they spend some time planning , organiz@@ ing , they sk@@ et@@ ch and they lay out sp@@ ag@@ h@@ et@@ ti .
They spend the majority of their time assembl@@ ing the stic@@ ks into ever@@ -@@ growing structures .
And then finally , just as they &apos;re running out of time , someone takes out the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low , and then they g@@ ing@@ er@@ ly put it on top , and then they stand back , and -- ta@@ -@@ da ! -- they ad@@ mi@@ re their work .
But what really happens , most of the time , is that the &quot; ta@@ -@@ da &quot; turns into an &quot; u@@ h@@ -@@ oh , &quot; because the weight of the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low causes the entire structure to bu@@ ck@@ le and to collap@@ se .
So there are a number of people who have a lot more &quot; u@@ h@@ -@@ oh &quot; moments than others , and among the worst are recent gradu@@ ates of business school .
They lie , they che@@ at , they get dis@@ trac@@ ted and they produce really l@@ ame structures .
And of course there are te@@ ams that have a lot more &quot; ta@@ -@@ da &quot; structures , and among the best are recent gradu@@ ates of kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten .
And it &apos;s pretty amazing .
As Peter tells us , not only do they produce the t@@ all@@ est structures , but they &apos;re the most interesting structures of them all .
So the question you want to ask is : How come ? Why ? What is it about them ?
And Peter li@@ kes to say that none of the kids spend any time trying to be CE@@ O of Sp@@ ag@@ h@@ et@@ ti , In@@ c . Right ?
They don &apos;t spend time j@@ oc@@ ke@@ ying for power .
But there &apos;s another reason as well .
And the reason is that business students are trained to find the single right plan , right ?
And then they ex@@ ecu@@ te on it .
And then what happens is , when they put the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low on the top , they run out of time and what happens ?
It &apos;s a crisis .
S@@ ound familiar ? Right .
What kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten@@ ers do differently is that they start with the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low , and they build prototy@@ pes , succ@@ essive prototy@@ pes , always keeping the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low on top , so they have multiple times to fix when they build prototy@@ pes along the way .
Des@@ ign@@ ers recognize this type of collaboration as the essence of the iter@@ ative process .
And with each version , kids get instant feedback about what works and what doesn &apos;t work .
So the capacity to play in prototype is really essential , but let &apos;s look at how different te@@ ams perform .
So the average for most people is around 20 in@@ ches ; business schools students , about half of that ; law@@ yers , a little better , but not much better than that , kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten@@ ers , better than most adults .
Who does the very best ?
Ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ects and engineers , th@@ ank@@ fully .
Th@@ ir@@ ty@@ -@@ nine in@@ ches is the t@@ all@@ est structure I &apos;ve seen .
And why is it ? Because they understand tri@@ angles and self-@@ re@@ in@@ forc@@ ing ge@@ om@@ e@@ tr@@ ical patterns are the key to building stable structures .
So CE@@ O@@ s , a little bit better than average , but here &apos;s where it gets interesting .
If you put you put an ex@@ ecu@@ tive ad@@ min@@ . on the team , they get signific@@ antly better .
It &apos;s incredible . You know , you look around , you go , &quot; Oh , that team &apos;s going to win . &quot;
You can just tell be@@ fore@@ hand . And why is that ?
Because they have special skills of facil@@ itation .
They manage the process , they understand the process .
And any team who man@@ ages and pays close attention to work will signific@@ antly improve the team &apos;s performance .
Sp@@ eci@@ alized skills and facil@@ itation skills are the combin@@ ation that leads to strong success .
If you have 10 te@@ ams that typic@@ ally perform , you &apos;ll get maybe six or so that have standing structures .
And I tried something interesting .
I thought , let &apos;s up the ante , once .
So I off@@ ered a 10,000 dollar pr@@ ize of software to the win@@ ning team .
So what do you think happened to these design students ?
What was the result ?
Here &apos;s what happened : Not one team had a standing structure .
If anyone had built , say , a one in@@ ch structure , they would have taken home the pr@@ ize .
So , isn &apos;t that interesting ? That high st@@ akes have a strong impact .
We did the exercise again with the same students .
What do you think happened then ?
So now they understand the value of prototy@@ ping .
So the same team went from being the very worst to being among the very best .
They produced the t@@ all@@ est structures in the least amount of time .
So there &apos;s deep lessons for us about the nature of incenti@@ ves and success .
So , you might ask : Why would anyone actually spend time writing a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challenge ?
And the reason is , I help create digital tools and processes to help te@@ ams build cars and video games and visual effects .
And what the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challenge does is it helps them identify the hidden assu@@ mp@@ tions .
Because , fran@@ kly , every project has its own mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low , doesn &apos;t it ?
The challenge provi@@ des a shared experience , a common language , a common st@@ ance to build the right prototype .
And so , this is the value of the experience , of this so simple exercise .
And those of you who are interested may want to go to Mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low@@ Ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge@@ .com .
It &apos;s a blog that you can look at how to build the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ lows .
There &apos;s ste@@ p@@ -@@ b@@ y-@@ step instructions on this .
There are crazy examples from around the world of how people tw@@ ea@@ k and ad@@ just the system .
There &apos;s world records that are on this as well .
And the fundamental lesson , I believe , is that design truly is a contact sport .
It dem@@ ands that we bring all of our sen@@ ses to the task , and that we apply the very best of our thinking , our feeling and our doing to the challenge that we have at hand .
And sometimes , a little prototype of this experience is all that it takes to turn us from an &quot; u@@ h@@ -@@ oh &quot; moment to a &quot; ta@@ -@@ da &quot; moment .
And that can make a big difference .
Thank you very much .
Let &apos;s pre@@ tend right here we have a machine .
A big machine , a cool , TED@@ -@@ ish machine , and it &apos;s a time machine .
And everyone in this room has to get into it .
And you can go back@@ wards , you can go for@@ wards ; you cannot stay where you are .
And I wonder what you &apos;d choose , because I &apos;ve been asking my friends this question a lot l@@ ately and they all want to go back .
I don &apos;t know . They want to go back before there were automobi@@ les or Twitter or &quot; American I@@ do@@ l . &quot;
I don &apos;t know .
I &apos;m convinced that there &apos;s some sort of pull to no@@ st@@ al@@ gi@@ a , to w@@ ish@@ ful thinking .
And I understand that .
I &apos;m not part of that crow@@ d , I have to say .
I don &apos;t want to go back , and it &apos;s not because I &apos;m ad@@ ven@@ tur@@ ous .
It &apos;s because possibilities on this planet , they don &apos;t go back , they go forward .
So I want to get in the machine , and I want to go forward .
This is the greatest time there &apos;s ever been on this planet by any measure that you wish to choose : health , wealth , mo@@ bility , opportunity , dec@@ lin@@ ing rates of disease ...
There &apos;s never been a time like this .
My great@@ -@@ grand@@ parents died , all of them , by the time they were 60 .
My grand@@ parents push@@ ed that number to 70 .
My parents are clo@@ sing in on 80 .
So there better be a nine at the beginning of my death number .
But it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is a bigger deal than that .
A kid born in New Del@@ hi today can expect to live as long as the rich@@ est man in the world did 100 years ago .
Think about that , it &apos;s an incredible fact .
And why is it true ?
Sm@@ all@@ po@@ x . Sm@@ all@@ po@@ x killed billions of people on this planet .
It res@@ h@@ ap@@ ed the dem@@ ograph@@ y of the globe in a way that no war ever has .
It &apos;s gone . It &apos;s van@@ ished .
We van@@ qu@@ ished it . Pu@@ ff .
In the rich world , diseases that threat@@ en@@ ed millions of us just a generation ago no longer exist , har@@ dly .
Di@@ ph@@ ther@@ ia , ru@@ bel@@ la , polio ...
does anyone even know what those things are ?
V@@ acc@@ ines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , those are tri@@ um@@ ph@@ s of the scientific method .
And to my mind , the scientific method -- trying stuff out , seeing if it works , changing it when it doesn &apos;t -- is one of the great accompl@@ ish@@ ments of humanity .
So that &apos;s the good news .
Un@@ fortunately , that &apos;s all the good news because there are some other problems , and they &apos;ve been mentioned many times .
And one of them is that despite all our accompl@@ ish@@ ments , a billion people go to bed hun@@ gry in this world every day .
That number &apos;s ris@@ ing , and it &apos;s ris@@ ing really rapidly , and it &apos;s dis@@ gr@@ ace@@ ful .
And not only that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to th@@ or@@ ough@@ ly tr@@ ash this globe .
P@@ ot@@ able water , ar@@ able land , rain@@ forests , oil , gas : they &apos;re going away , and they &apos;re going away soon , and unless we innov@@ ate our way out of this m@@ ess , we &apos;re going away too .
So the question is : Can we do that ? And I think we can .
I think it &apos;s clear that we can make food that will feed billions of people without rap@@ ing the land that they live on .
I think we can power this world with energy that doesn &apos;t also destro@@ y it .
I really do believe that , and , no , it ain &apos;t w@@ ish@@ ful thinking .
But here &apos;s the thing that kee@@ ps me up at night -- one of the things that kee@@ ps me up at night : We &apos;ve never needed progress in science more than we need it right now . N@@ ever .
And we &apos;ve also never been in a position to depl@@ o@@ y it proper@@ ly in the way that we can today .
We &apos;re on the ver@@ ge of amazing , amazing events in many fields , and yet I actually think we &apos;d have to go back hundreds , 300 years , before the En@@ li@@ ghten@@ ment , to find a time when we batt@@ led progress , when we f@@ ought about these things more vi@@ gor@@ ously , on more fron@@ ts , than we do now .
People w@@ ra@@ p themselves in their beli@@ efs , and they do it so ti@@ ghtly that you can &apos;t set them free .
Not even the truth will set them free .
And , listen , everyone &apos;s enti@@ t@@ led to their opinion ; they &apos;re even enti@@ t@@ led to their opinion about progress .
But you know what you &apos;re not enti@@ t@@ led to ?
You &apos;re not enti@@ t@@ led to your own facts . S@@ or@@ ry , you &apos;re not .
And this took me a@@ while to figure out .
A@@ bout a decade ago , I wrote a story about vacc@@ ines for The New Yor@@ ker . A little story .
And I was amaz@@ ed to find op@@ position : op@@ position to what is , after all , the most effective public health measure in human history .
I didn &apos;t know what to do , so I just did what I do : I wrote a story and I moved on .
And soon after that , I wrote a story about gene@@ tically engine@@ ered food .
S@@ ame thing , only bigger .
People were going crazy .
So I wrote a story about that too , and I couldn &apos;t understand why people thought this was &quot; Fr@@ ank@@ en@@ fo@@ ods , &quot; why they thought moving molecules around in a specific , rather than a h@@ aph@@ az@@ ard way , was tr@@ es@@ pass@@ ing on nature &apos;s ground .
But , you know , I do what I do . I wrote the story , I moved on .
I mean , I &apos;m a journalis@@ t .
We type , we file , we go to dinner . It &apos;s fine .
But these stories bo@@ ther@@ ed me , and I couldn &apos;t figure out why , and eventually I did .
And that &apos;s because those f@@ an@@ ati@@ cs that were driving me crazy weren &apos;t actually f@@ an@@ ati@@ cs at all .
They were thou@@ ght@@ ful people , educ@@ ated people , dec@@ ent people .
They were exactly like the people in this room .
And it just dis@@ tur@@ bed me so much .
But then I thought , you know , let &apos;s be honest .
We &apos;re at a point in this world where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress that we used to .
We talk about it ambi@@ val@@ ently .
We talk about it in iron@@ ic terms with little quot@@ es around it : &quot; progress . &quot;
Okay , there are reasons for that , and I think we know what those reasons are .
We &apos;ve lost faith in institutions , in auth@@ ority , and sometimes in science itself , and there &apos;s no reason we shouldn &apos;t have .
You can just say a few names and people will understand .
Ch@@ er@@ no@@ by@@ l , B@@ hop@@ al , the Ch@@ all@@ eng@@ er , Vi@@ ox@@ x , weapons of mass destruction , h@@ ang@@ ing cha@@ ds .
You know , you can choose your list .
There are questions and problems with the people we used to believe were always right , so be s@@ ke@@ p@@ tical .
As@@ k questions , demand pro@@ of , demand evidence .
Don &apos;t take anything for gran@@ ted .
But here &apos;s the thing : When you get pro@@ of , you need to accept the pro@@ of , and we &apos;re not that good at doing that .
And the reason that I can say that is because we &apos;re now in an epidemic of fear like one I &apos;ve never seen and hope never to see again .
A@@ bout 12 years ago , there was a story published , a horrible story , that lin@@ ked the epidemic of autism to the me@@ as@@ les , mu@@ m@@ ps and ru@@ bel@@ la vacc@@ ine shot .
Very scar@@ y .
T@@ ons of studies were done to see if this was true .
T@@ ons of studies should have been done ; it &apos;s a serious issue .
The data came back .
The data came back from the United States , from England , from Swe@@ den , from Canada , and it was all the same : no cor@@ relation , no connection , none at all .
It doesn &apos;t matter . It doesn &apos;t matter because we believe an@@ ec@@ d@@ otes , we believe what we see , what we think we see , what makes us feel real .
We don &apos;t believe a bunch of documents from a government offici@@ al giving us data , and I do understand that , I think we all do .
But you know what ?
The result of that has been dis@@ astr@@ ous .
Dis@@ astr@@ ous because here &apos;s a fact : The United States is one of the only countries in the world where the vacc@@ ine rate for me@@ as@@ les is going down .
That is dis@@ gr@@ ace@@ ful , and we should be ash@@ amed of ourselves .
It &apos;s horrible .
What kind of a thing happened that we could do that ?
Now , I understand it . I do understand it .
Because , did anyone have me@@ as@@ les here ?
H@@ as one person in this audience ever seen someone die of me@@ as@@ les ?
Do@@ esn &apos;t happen very much .
Do@@ esn &apos;t happen in this country at all , but it happened 16@@ 0,000 times in the world last year .
That &apos;s a lot of death of me@@ as@@ les -- 20 an hour .
But since it didn &apos;t happen here , we can put it out of our minds , and people like J@@ enn@@ y Mc@@ Car@@ thy can go around pre@@ ach@@ ing messages of fear and ill@@ iter@@ acy from plat@@ forms like &quot; O@@ pr@@ ah &quot; and &quot; L@@ arry King Li@@ ve . &quot;
And they can do it because they don &apos;t link caus@@ ation and cor@@ relation .
They don &apos;t understand that these things seem the same , but they &apos;re almost never the same .
And it &apos;s something we need to learn , and we need to learn it really soon .
This guy was a her@@ o , Jon@@ as S@@ alk .
He took one of the worst s@@ cour@@ ges of man@@ kind away from us .
No fear , no ag@@ ony . Po@@ li@@ o -- pu@@ ff , gone .
That guy in the middle , not so much .
His name is Paul O@@ ff@@ it .
He just developed a rot@@ av@@ ir@@ us vacc@@ ine with a bunch of other people .
It &apos;ll save the lives of 400 to 5@@ 00,000 kids in the developing world every year .
P@@ ret@@ ty good , right ?
Well , it &apos;s good , except that Paul goes around talking about vacc@@ ines and says how valuable they are and that people ought to just stop the wh@@ in@@ ing .
And he actually says it that way .
So , Paul &apos;s a terror@@ ist .
When Paul spea@@ ks in a public hearing , he can &apos;t t@@ esti@@ fy without arm@@ ed gu@@ ards .
He gets called at home because people like to tell him that they remember where his kids go to school .
And why ? Because Paul made a vacc@@ ine .
I don &apos;t need to say this , but vacc@@ ines are essential .
You take them away , disease comes back , horrible diseases . And that &apos;s happening .
We have me@@ as@@ les in this country now .
And it &apos;s getting worse , and pretty soon kids are going to die of it again because it &apos;s just a numbers game .
And they &apos;re not just going to die of me@@ as@@ les .
What about polio ? Let &apos;s have that . Why not ?
A college class@@ mate of mine wrote me a couple weeks ago and said she thought I was a little str@@ ident .
No one &apos;s ever said that before .
She wasn &apos;t going to vacc@@ in@@ ate her kid against polio , no way .
F@@ ine .
Why ? Because we don &apos;t have polio . And you know what ?
We didn &apos;t have polio in this country yesterday .
Today , I don &apos;t know , maybe a guy got on a plane in L@@ ag@@ os this morning , and he &apos;s flying to L@@ A@@ X , right now he &apos;s over O@@ hi@@ o .
And he &apos;s going to land in a couple of hours , he &apos;s going to rent a car , and he &apos;s going to come to L@@ ong B@@ each , and he &apos;s going to attend one of these fabul@@ ous TED din@@ ners ton@@ ight .
And he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s inf@@ ected with a paraly@@ tic disease , and we don &apos;t either because that &apos;s the way the world works .
That &apos;s the planet we live on . Don &apos;t pre@@ tend it isn &apos;t .
Now , we love to w@@ ra@@ p ourselves in lies . We love to do it .
Every@@ one take their vit@@ am@@ ins this morning ?
E@@ ch@@ in@@ ace@@ a , a little anti@@ ox@@ id@@ ant to get you going .
I know you did because half of Americans do every day .
They take the stuff , and they take alternative medic@@ ines , and it doesn &apos;t matter how often we find out that they &apos;re us@@ eless .
The data says it all the time .
They dar@@ ken your ur@@ ine . They almost never do more than that .
It &apos;s okay , you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark ur@@ ine ?
I &apos;m totally with you .
Dar@@ k ur@@ ine . Dar@@ k .
Why do we do that ? Why do we do that ?
Well , I think I understand , we hate Big P@@ har@@ ma .
We hate Big Go@@ vern@@ ment . We don &apos;t trust the Man .
And we shouldn &apos;t : Our health care system suc@@ ks .
It &apos;s cru@@ el to millions of people .
It &apos;s absolutely as@@ ton@@ ish@@ ingly cold and sou@@ l@@ -@@ b@@ ending to those of us who can even afford it .
So we run away from it , and where do we run ?
We lea@@ p into the arms of Big Pl@@ ace@@ bo .
That &apos;s fantastic . I love Big Pl@@ ace@@ bo .
But , you know , it &apos;s really a serious thing because this stuff is cr@@ ap , and we spend billions of dollars on it .
And I have all sorts of little pro@@ ps here .
N@@ one of it ... gin@@ k@@ go , fr@@ au@@ d ; ech@@ in@@ ace@@ a , fr@@ au@@ d ; ac@@ ai -- I don &apos;t even know what that is but we &apos;re spending billions of dollars on it -- it &apos;s fr@@ au@@ d .
And you know what ? When I say this stuff , people scre@@ am at me , and they say , &quot; What do you care ? Let people do what they want to do .
It makes them feel good . &quot;
And you know what ? You &apos;re wrong .
Because I don &apos;t care if it &apos;s the sec@@ ret@@ ary of H@@ H@@ S who &apos;s saying , &quot; H@@ mm , I &apos;m not going to take the evidence of my experts on mam@@ mo@@ gr@@ ams , &quot; or some cancer qu@@ ack who wants to treat his patient with coffee enem@@ as .
When you start down the road where belief and magic re@@ place evidence and science , you end up in a place you don &apos;t want to be .
You end up in Th@@ ab@@ o M@@ be@@ ki South Africa .
He killed 4@@ 00,000 of his people by ins@@ is@@ ting that be@@ e@@ tro@@ ot , gar@@ lic and lem@@ on oil were much more effective than the anti@@ re@@ tro@@ vir@@ al drugs we know can slow the course of AIDS .
Hun@@ dre@@ ds of thousands of nee@@ d@@ less dea@@ ths in a country that has been pl@@ ag@@ u@@ ed worse than any other by this disease .
Please , don &apos;t tell me there are no consequences to these things .
There are . There always are .
Now , the most min@@ d@@ less epidemic we &apos;re in the middle of right now is this ab@@ sur@@ d bat@@ tle between pro@@ pon@@ ents of gene@@ tically engine@@ ered food and the organic el@@ ite .
It &apos;s an idi@@ o@@ tic debate . It has to stop .
It &apos;s a debate about words , about met@@ ap@@ hors .
It &apos;s ide@@ ology , it &apos;s not science .
Every single thing we eat , every grain of ri@@ ce , every s@@ pri@@ g of par@@ s@@ ley , every Br@@ us@@ sel@@ s spr@@ out has been modi@@ fied by man .
You know , there weren &apos;t t@@ anger@@ ines in the gar@@ den of E@@ den .
There wasn &apos;t any can@@ tal@@ ou@@ pe . There weren &apos;t Christ@@ mas trees . We made it all .
We made it over the last 1@@ 1,000 years .
And some of it worked , and some of it didn &apos;t .
We got rid of the stuff that didn &apos;t .
Now we can do it in a more pre@@ c@@ ise way -- and there are risks , absolutely -- but we can put something like vit@@ am@@ in A into ri@@ ce , and that stuff can help millions of people , millions of people , pro@@ long their lives .
You don &apos;t want to do that ?
I have to say , I don &apos;t understand it .
We object to gene@@ tically engine@@ ered food .
Why do we do that ?
Well , the things I constantly hear are : To@@ o many chemicals , p@@ esti@@ ci@@ des , hormon@@ es , mon@@ o@@ culture , we don &apos;t want giant fields of the same thing , that &apos;s wrong .
We don &apos;t companies pat@@ enting life .
We don &apos;t want companies ow@@ ning see@@ ds .
And you know what my response to all of that is ?
Yes , you &apos;re right . Let &apos;s fix it .
It &apos;s true , we &apos;ve got a huge food problem , but this isn &apos;t science .
This has nothing to do with science .
It &apos;s law , it &apos;s mor@@ ality , it &apos;s pat@@ ent stuff .
You know science isn &apos;t a company .
It &apos;s not a country .
It &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
It &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn &apos;t , but the idea that we should not allow science to do its job because we &apos;re afraid , is really very dea@@ den@@ ing , and it &apos;s prev@@ enting millions of people from pro@@ sper@@ ing .
You know , in the next 50 years we &apos;re going to have to grow 70 percent more food than we do right now , 70 percent .
This investment in Africa over the last 30 years .
Dis@@ gr@@ ace@@ ful . Dis@@ gr@@ ace@@ ful .
They need it , and we &apos;re not giving it to them .
And why ? Gen@@ e@@ tically engine@@ ered food .
We don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat that rot@@ ten stuff , like cass@@ av@@ a for instance .
C@@ ass@@ av@@ a &apos;s something that half a billion people eat .
It &apos;s kind of like a po@@ ta@@ to .
It &apos;s just a bunch of cal@@ ories . It suc@@ ks .
It doesn &apos;t have nutri@@ ents , it doesn &apos;t have protein , and scientists are engineering all of that into it right now .
And then people would be able to eat it and they &apos;d be able to not go blind .
They wouldn &apos;t star@@ ve , and you know what ?
That would be nice . It wouldn &apos;t be Ch@@ ez Pan@@ is@@ se , but it would be nice .
And all I can say about this is : Why are we fighting it ?
I mean , let &apos;s ask ourselves : Why are we fighting it ?
Because we don &apos;t want to move genes around ?
This is about moving genes around . It &apos;s not about chemicals .
It &apos;s not about our ridi@@ cul@@ ous passion for hormon@@ es , our ins@@ ist@@ ence on having bigger food , better food , sing@@ ular food .
This isn &apos;t about R@@ ice K@@ ris@@ pi@@ es , this is about keeping people alive , and it &apos;s about time we started to understand what that meant .
Because , you know something ?
If we don &apos;t , if we continue to act the way we &apos;re acting , we &apos;re gu@@ il@@ ty of something that I don &apos;t think we want to be gu@@ il@@ ty of : high-@@ tech colon@@ i@@ alism .
There &apos;s no other way to describe what &apos;s going on here .
It &apos;s sel@@ fish , it &apos;s u@@ g@@ ly , it &apos;s bene@@ ath us , and we really have to stop it .
So after this amaz@@ ingly fun conversation , you might want to say , &quot; So , you still want to get in this ridi@@ cul@@ ous time machine and go forward ? &quot;
Ab@@ solu@@ tely . Ab@@ solu@@ tely , I do .
It &apos;s stuck in the present right now , but we have an amazing opportunity .
We can set that time machine on anything we want .
We can move it where we want to move it , and we &apos;re going to move it where we want to move it .
We have to have these conversations and we have to think , but when we get in the time machine and we go ahead , we &apos;re going to be happy we do .
I know that we can , and as far as I &apos;m concerned , that &apos;s something the world needs right now .
Thank you .
One day , Los Angeles Times col@@ um@@ n@@ ist Steve L@@ op@@ ez was walking along the streets of down@@ town Los Angeles when he heard beautiful music .
And the source was a man , an Afri@@ can@@ -@@ American man , char@@ ming , ru@@ gg@@ ed , hom@@ eless , playing a vi@@ o@@ lin that only had two str@@ ings .
And I &apos;m telling a story that many of you know , because Steve &apos;s col@@ um@@ ns became the basis for a book , which was turned into a movie , with Robert D@@ ow@@ ney J@@ r@@ . acting as Steve L@@ op@@ ez , and J@@ amie F@@ ox@@ x as N@@ ath@@ aniel An@@ th@@ ony A@@ yers , the Ju@@ illi@@ ar@@ d-@@ trained double b@@ ass@@ ist whose prom@@ is@@ ing career was cut short by a trag@@ ic aff@@ lic@@ tion with par@@ an@@ oid schizoph@@ ren@@ ia .
N@@ ath@@ aniel dro@@ pped out of Ju@@ illi@@ ard , he suff@@ ered a complete break@@ down , and 30 years later he was living hom@@ eless on the streets of S@@ kid R@@ ow in down@@ town Los Angeles .
I encourage all of you to read Steve &apos;s book or to watch the movie to understand not only the beautiful bon@@ d that formed between these two men , but how music helped shape that bon@@ d , and ultimately was instru@@ mental -- if you &apos;ll par@@ don the p@@ un -- in helping N@@ ath@@ aniel get off the streets .
I met Mr. A@@ yers in 2008 , two years ago , at Wal@@ t Dis@@ ney Con@@ cer@@ t H@@ all .
He had just heard a performance of Be@@ eth@@ o@@ ven &apos;s First and F@@ our@@ th sym@@ phon@@ ies , and came back@@ stage and introduced himself .
He was speaking in a very jo@@ vi@@ al and gre@@ gar@@ ious way about Y@@ o-@@ Y@@ o Ma and H@@ ill@@ ary Cl@@ int@@ on and how the D@@ od@@ gers were never going to make the World Ser@@ ies , all because of the tre@@ ach@@ er@@ ous first vi@@ o@@ lin passage work in the last movement of Be@@ eth@@ o@@ ven &apos;s F@@ our@@ th Sy@@ m@@ ph@@ ony .
And we got talking about music , and I got an email from Steve a few days later saying that N@@ ath@@ aniel was interested in a vi@@ o@@ lin lesson with me .
Now , I should mention that N@@ ath@@ aniel ref@@ uses treatment because when he was treated it was with shoc@@ k therapy and Th@@ or@@ az@@ ine and hand@@ cu@@ ff@@ s , and that sc@@ ar has st@@ ayed with him for his entire life .
But as a result now , he is pr@@ one to these schizoph@@ ren@@ ic ep@@ is@@ o@@ des , the worst of which can manif@@ est themselves as him explo@@ ding and then dis@@ appear@@ ing for days , wan@@ der@@ ing the streets of S@@ kid R@@ ow , ex@@ posed to its hor@@ r@@ ors , with the tor@@ ment of his own mind un@@ le@@ ash@@ ed upon him .
And N@@ ath@@ aniel was in such a state of ag@@ itation when we started our first lesson at Wal@@ t Dis@@ ney Con@@ cer@@ t H@@ all -- he had a kind of man@@ ic gl@@ int in his eyes , he was lost .
And he was talking about invisible dem@@ ons and smo@@ ke , and how someone was pois@@ oning him in his sleep .
And I was afraid , not for myself , but I was afraid that I was going to lose him , that he was going to sin@@ k into one of his states , and that I would ru@@ in his relationship with the vi@@ o@@ lin if I started talking about sc@@ ales and ar@@ pe@@ g@@ gi@@ os and other exciting forms of di@@ d@@ ac@@ tic vi@@ o@@ lin pe@@ d@@ ag@@ o@@ g@@ y .
So , I just started playing .
And I played the first movement of the Be@@ eth@@ o@@ ven Vi@@ o@@ lin Con@@ cer@@ to .
And as I played , I understood that there was a profound change occur@@ ring in N@@ ath@@ aniel &apos;s eyes .
It was as if he was in the gri@@ p of some invisible pharmaceu@@ tical , a chemical reaction , for which my playing the music was its cat@@ aly@@ st .
And N@@ ath@@ aniel &apos;s man@@ ic r@@ age was transform@@ ed into understanding , a qui@@ et curios@@ ity and gr@@ ace .
And in a miracle , he lif@@ ted his own vi@@ o@@ lin and he started playing , by ear , certain s@@ ni@@ p@@ pe@@ ts of vi@@ o@@ lin concer@@ to@@ s which he then asked me to complete -- M@@ end@@ el@@ s@@ so@@ h@@ n , T@@ ch@@ ai@@ k@@ o@@ v@@ sky , Si@@ beli@@ us .
And we started talking about music , from B@@ ach to Be@@ eth@@ o@@ ven and Bra@@ h@@ ms , B@@ ru@@ ck@@ ner , all the B &apos;s , from Bar@@ t@@ ó@@ k , all the way up to E@@ sa@@ -@@ Pe@@ k@@ ka Sal@@ on@@ en .
And I understood that he not only had an enc@@ y@@ clo@@ pe@@ di@@ c knowledge of music , but he related to this music at a personal level .
He spoke about it with the kind of passion and understanding that I share with my colleagues in the Los Angeles Phil@@ harmon@@ ic .
And through playing music and talking about music , this man had transform@@ ed from the par@@ an@@ oid , dis@@ tur@@ bed man that had just come from walking the streets of down@@ town Los Angeles to the char@@ ming , er@@ u@@ d@@ ite , brilliant , Ju@@ illi@@ ar@@ d-@@ trained musici@@ an .
Mu@@ si@@ c is medicine . Mu@@ si@@ c changes us .
And for N@@ ath@@ aniel , music is san@@ ity .
Because music allows him to take his thoughts and del@@ u@@ sions and shape them through his imagination and his creativity , into reality .
And that is an es@@ cape from his tor@@ ment@@ ed state .
And I understood that this was the very essence of art .
This was the very reason why we made music , that we take something that exists within all of us at our very fundamental core , our emotions , and through our arti@@ stic l@@ ens , through our creativity , we &apos;re able to shape those emotions into reality .
And the reality of that expression re@@ aches all of us and moves us , insp@@ ires and un@@ ites us .
And for N@@ ath@@ aniel , music brought him back into a fold of friends .
The red@@ emp@@ tive power of music brought him back into a family of musici@@ ans that understood him , that recogni@@ zed his talents and resp@@ ected him .
And I will always make music with N@@ ath@@ aniel , whether we &apos;re at Wal@@ t Dis@@ ney Con@@ cer@@ t H@@ all or on S@@ kid R@@ ow , because he re@@ minds me why I became a musici@@ an .
Thank you .
Brun@@ o Gi@@ us@@ san@@ i : Thank you . Thanks .
Robert G@@ up@@ ta .
Robert G@@ up@@ ta : I &apos;m going to play something that I sh@@ am@@ el@@ ess@@ ly st@@ ole from cell@@ ists .
So , please for@@ give me .
I &apos;m J@@ ane Mc@@ G@@ on@@ ig@@ al . I &apos;m a game designer .
I &apos;ve been making games online now for 10 years , and my goal for the next decade is to try to make it as easy to save the world in real life as it is to save the world in online games .
Now , I have a plan for this , and it ent@@ ails convinc@@ ing more people , including all of you , to spend more time playing bigger and better games .
Right now we spend three billion hours a week playing online games .
Some of you might be thinking , &quot; That &apos;s a lot of time to spend playing games .
Maybe too much time , consider@@ ing how many ur@@ gent problems we have to solve in the real world . &quot;
But actually , according to my research at the Institute for the F@@ u@@ ture , actually the opposite is true .
Three billion hours a week is not nearly enough game play to solve the world &apos;s most ur@@ gent problems .
In fact , I believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to increase that total dram@@ atically .
I &apos;ve calcul@@ ated the total we need at 21 billion hours of game play every week .
So , that &apos;s probably a bit of a counter@@ -@@ intu@@ itive idea , so I &apos;ll say it again , let it sin@@ k in : If we want to solve problems like hun@@ ger , poverty , climate change , global conflict , ob@@ es@@ ity , I believe that we need to asp@@ ire to play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week , by the end of the next decade .
No . I &apos;m serious . I am .
Here &apos;s why .
This picture pretty much su@@ ms up why I think games are so essential to the future survival of the human species . Tr@@ u@@ ly .
This is a por@@ trait by photograp@@ her Ph@@ il T@@ ol@@ ed@@ ano .
He wanted to capture the emotion of gam@@ ing , so he set up a camera in front of gam@@ ers while they were playing .
And this is a classi@@ c gam@@ ing emotion .
Now , if you &apos;re not a gam@@ er , you might mis@@ s some of the nu@@ ance in this photo .
You probably see the sense of ur@@ gency , a little bit of fear , but intense concentration , deep , deep focus on t@@ ack@@ ling a really difficult problem .
If you are a gam@@ er , you will notice a few nu@@ ances here : the cr@@ in@@ k@@ le of the eyes up , and around the mouth is a sign of optimis@@ m , and the ey@@ e@@ bro@@ ws up is surprise .
This is a gam@@ er who &apos;s on the ver@@ ge of something called an &quot; epi@@ c win . &quot;
Oh , you &apos;ve heard of that .
OK , good , so we have some gam@@ ers among us .
An epi@@ c win is an out@@ come that is so extraordin@@ arily positive , you had no idea it was even possible until you achiev@@ ed it .
It was almost beyond the th@@ res@@ hold of imagination , and when you get there , you &apos;re shoc@@ ked to discover what you &apos;re truly capable of .
That &apos;s an epi@@ c win .
This is a gam@@ er on the ver@@ ge of an epi@@ c win .
And this is the face that we need to see on millions of probl@@ em@@ -@@ sol@@ vers all over the world as we try to t@@ ack@@ le the obstacles of the next century -- the face of someone who , against all od@@ ds , is on the ver@@ ge of an epi@@ c win .
Now , unfortunately this is more of the face that we see in everyday life now as we try to t@@ ack@@ le ur@@ gent problems .
This is what I call the &quot; I &apos;m Not Good At Life &quot; face .
This is actually me making it . Can you see ? Yes . Good .
This is me making the &quot; I &apos;m Not Good At Life &quot; face .
This is a piece of gr@@ aff@@ it@@ i in my old neighborhood in Ber@@ k@@ el@@ ey , California , where I did my Ph@@ D on why we &apos;re better in games than we are in real life .
And this is a problem that a lot of gam@@ ers have .
We feel that we are not as good in reality as we are in games .
I don &apos;t mean just good as in successful , although that &apos;s part of it .
We do achieve more in game worlds .
But I also mean good as in motiv@@ ated to do something that matters -- inspired to collabor@@ ate and to co@@ operate .
And when we &apos;re in game worlds , I believe that many of us become the best version of ourselves -- the most likely to help at a moment &apos;s notice , the most likely to stick with a problem as long at it takes , to get up after failure and try again .
And in real life , when we face failure , when we con@@ front obstacles , we often don &apos;t feel that way .
We feel over@@ come , we feel over@@ wh@@ el@@ med , we feel anx@@ ious , maybe de@@ pressed , frustr@@ ated or cy@@ n@@ ical .
We never have those feelings when we &apos;re playing games , they just don &apos;t exist in games .
So that &apos;s what I wanted to study when I was a graduate student .
What about games makes it impossible to feel that we can &apos;t achieve everything ?
How can we take those feelings from games and apply them to re@@ al-@@ world work ?
So I looked at games like World of War@@ craft , which is really the ide@@ al collabor@@ ative probl@@ em@@ -@@ solving environment .
And I started to notice a few things that make epi@@ c w@@ ins so possible in online worlds .
The first thing is whenever you show up in one of these online games , especially in World of War@@ craft , there are lots and lots of different characters who are willing to trust you with a worl@@ d-@@ saving mission , right away .
But not just any mission , it &apos;s a mission that is perfectly mat@@ ched with your current level in the game .
Right ? So you can do it .
They never give you a challenge you can &apos;t achieve .
But it is on the ver@@ ge of what you &apos;re capable of , so you have to try hard .
But there &apos;s no un@@ employ@@ ment in World of War@@ craft ; no sitting around , wr@@ inging your hands -- there &apos;s always something specific and important to be done .
There are also tons of collabor@@ ators .
Every@@ where you go , hundreds of thousands of people ready to work with you to achieve your epi@@ c mission .
That &apos;s not something we have in real life that easily , this sense that at our fin@@ ger@@ ti@@ ps are tons of collabor@@ ators .
And there &apos;s this epi@@ c story , this inspir@@ ing story of why we &apos;re there , and what we &apos;re doing , and we get all this positive feedback .
You guys have heard of lev@@ eling up , + 1 strength , + 1 intelligence .
We don &apos;t get that kind of constant feedback in real life .
When I get off this stage , I &apos;m not going to have + 1 speaking , and + 1 crazy idea , + 20 crazy idea .
I don &apos;t get that feedback in real life .
Now , the problem with collabor@@ ative online environments like World of War@@ craft is that it &apos;s so satis@@ fying to be on the ver@@ ge of an epi@@ c win all the time , we decide to spend all our time in these game worlds .
It &apos;s just better than reality .
So , so far , collec@@ tively all the World of War@@ craft gam@@ ers have spent 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years solving the virtual problems of A@@ zer@@ oth .
Now , that &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing .
It might sound like it &apos;s a bad thing .
But to put that in context : 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years ago was when our ear@@ li@@ est prim@@ ate human ancest@@ ors stood up .
That was the first u@@ pr@@ ight prim@@ ate .
So when we talk about how much time we &apos;re currently inv@@ esting in playing games , the only way it makes sense to even think about it is to talk about time at the mag@@ n@@ itude of human evolution , which is an extraordinary thing .
But it &apos;s also ap@@ t , because it turns out that by spending all this time playing games , we &apos;re actually changing what we are capable of as human beings .
We &apos;re evol@@ ving to be a more collabor@@ ative and hear@@ ty species .
This is true . I believe this .
So , consider this really interesting stati@@ stic ; it was recently published by a resear@@ cher at Car@@ ne@@ gie M@@ ell@@ on University : The average young person today in a country with a strong gam@@ er culture will have spent 10,000 hours playing online games by the age of 21 .
Now 10,000 hours is a really interesting number for two reasons .
First of all , for children in the United States , 10@@ ,@@ 0@@ 80 hours is the exact amount of time you will spend in school , from fi@@ f@@ th grade to high school gradu@@ ation , if you have perfect attend@@ ance .
So , we have an entire par@@ alle@@ l track of education going on , where young people are learning as much about what it takes to be a good gam@@ er as they &apos;re learning about everything else in school .
Some of you have probably read Mal@@ col@@ m G@@ lad@@ well &apos;s new book &quot; Ou@@ t@@ li@@ ers , &quot; so you would have heard of his theory of success , the &quot; 10,000 hours &quot; theory of success .
It &apos;s based on this great cogni@@ tiv@@ e-@@ science research that says if we can master 10,000 hours of effor@@ t@@ ful study at anything by the age of 21 , we will be virtu@@ o@@ so@@ s at it .
as the greatest people in the world .
And so , now what we &apos;re looking at is an entire generation of young people who are virtu@@ o@@ so gam@@ ers .
So , the big question is , &quot; What exactly are gam@@ ers getting so good at ? &quot;
Because if we could figure that out , we would have a vir@@ tually un@@ pre@@ ce@@ d@@ ented human resource on our hands .
This is how many people we now have in the world who spend at least an hour a day playing online games .
These are our virtu@@ o@@ so gam@@ ers , 500 million people who are extraordin@@ arily good at something .
And in the next decade , we &apos;re going to have another billion gam@@ ers who are extraordin@@ arily good at whatever that is .
If you don &apos;t know it already , this is coming .
The game industry is developing con@@ so@@ les that are low-@@ energy and that work with the wi@@ rel@@ ess phone networks instead of broad@@ band Internet , so that gam@@ ers all over the world , particularly in India , China , Brazil , can get online .
They expect one billion more gam@@ ers in the next decade .
It will bring us up to 1.@@ 5 billion gam@@ ers .
So I &apos;ve started to think about what these games are making us virtu@@ o@@ so@@ s at .
Here are the four things I came up with . The first is ur@@ gent optimis@@ m .
OK , think of this as extreme self-@@ motivation .
U@@ r@@ gent optimis@@ m is the desire to act immediately to t@@ ack@@ le an obstac@@ le , combin@@ ed with the belief that we have a reas@@ on@@ able hope of success .
G@@ am@@ ers always believe that an epi@@ c win is possible , and that it &apos;s always worth trying , and trying now .
G@@ am@@ ers don &apos;t sit around .
G@@ am@@ ers are virtu@@ o@@ so@@ s at we@@ aving a ti@@ ght social fabri@@ c .
There &apos;s a lot of interesting research that shows we like people better after we play a game with them , even if they &apos;ve be@@ at@@ en us bad@@ ly .
And the reason is , it takes a lot of trust to play a game with someone .
We trust that they will spend their time with us , that they will play by the same rules , value the same goal , stay with the game until it &apos;s over .
And so , playing a game together actually buil@@ ds up bon@@ ds and trust and co@@ operation .
And we actually build strong@@ er social relationships as a result .
Bl@@ iss@@ ful produc@@ tivity . I love it .
You know , there &apos;s a reason why the average World of War@@ craft gam@@ er plays for 22 hours a week -- kind of a hal@@ f-@@ time job .
It &apos;s because we know , when we &apos;re playing a game , that we &apos;re actually happ@@ ier working hard than we are rel@@ ax@@ ing , or h@@ ang@@ ing out .
We know that we are opti@@ mi@@ zed as human beings , to do hard and meaning@@ ful work .
And gam@@ ers are willing to work hard all the time , if they &apos;re given the right work .
Fin@@ ally : epi@@ c meaning .
G@@ am@@ ers love to be atta@@ ched to a@@ we@@ -@@ inspir@@ ing mis@@ sions to human plan@@ et@@ ar@@ y-@@ scale stories .
So , just one bit of tri@@ via that helps put that into perspective : So , you all know Wikipedia , biggest wi@@ ki in the world .
Second biggest wi@@ ki in the world , with nearly 8@@ 0,000 articles , is the World of War@@ craft wi@@ ki .
F@@ ive million people use it every month .
They have comp@@ il@@ ed more information about World of War@@ craft on the Internet than any other top@@ ic covered on any other wi@@ ki in the world .
They are building an epi@@ c story .
They are building an epi@@ c knowledge resource about the World of War@@ craft .
Okay , so these are four super@@ po@@ wers that add up to one thing : G@@ am@@ ers are super-@@ em@@ powered hop@@ eful individuals .
These are people who believe that they are individu@@ ally capable of changing the world .
And the only problem is , they believe that they are capable of changing virtual worlds and not the real world .
That &apos;s the problem that I &apos;m trying to solve .
There &apos;s an econom@@ ist named Ed@@ ward C@@ astr@@ on@@ o@@ va .
His work is brilliant .
He looks at why people are inv@@ esting so much time and energy and money in online worlds .
&quot; We &apos;re wit@@ n@@ essing what amoun@@ ts to no less than a mass ex@@ od@@ us to virtual worlds and online game environments . &quot;
And he &apos;s an econom@@ ist , so he &apos;s rational .
And he says -- Not like me , I &apos;m a game designer ; I &apos;m exu@@ ber@@ ant .
But he says that this makes perfect sense , because gam@@ ers can achieve more in online worlds than they can in real life .
They can have strong@@ er social relationships in games than they can have in real life ; they get better feedback and feel more re@@ war@@ ded in games than they do in real life .
So he says , for now it makes perfect sense for gam@@ ers to spend more time in virtual worlds than the real world .
Now , I also agree that that is rational , for now .
But it is not , by any means , an opti@@ mal situation .
We have to start making the real world work more like a game .
I take my inspiration from something that happened 2,@@ 500 years ago .
These are ancient di@@ ce , made out of she@@ ep &apos;s k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les .
Be@@ fore we had awesome game controll@@ ers , we had she@@ ep &apos;s k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les .
And these represent the first game equipment designed by human beings , and if you &apos;re familiar with the work of the ancient Gre@@ ek histori@@ an Her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , you might know this history , which is the history of who invented games and why .
Her@@ od@@ ot@@ us says that games , particularly di@@ ce games , were invented in the k@@ ing@@ dom of L@@ y@@ dia , during a time of fam@@ ine .
Ap@@ par@@ ently , there was such a sev@@ ere fam@@ ine that the king of L@@ y@@ dia decided they had to do something crazy .
People were suffering . People were fighting .
It was an extreme situation , they needed an extreme solution .
So , according to Her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , they invented di@@ ce games , and they set up a k@@ ing@@ dom@@ -@@ wide policy : On one day , everybody would eat , and on the next day , everybody would play games .
And they would be so immer@@ sed in playing the di@@ ce games , because games are so engag@@ ing , and immer@@ se us in such satis@@ fying , bl@@ iss@@ ful produc@@ tivity , they would ignore the fact that they had no food to eat .
And then on the next day , they would play games ; and on the next day , they would eat .
And according to Her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , they passed 18 years this way , survi@@ ving through a fam@@ ine , by eating on one day , and playing games on the next .
Now , this is exactly , I think , how we &apos;re using games today .
We &apos;re using games to es@@ cape re@@ al-@@ world suffering -- we &apos;re using games to get away from everything that &apos;s broken in the real environment , everything that &apos;s not satis@@ fying about real life , and we &apos;re getting what we need from games .
But it doesn &apos;t have to end there .
This is really exciting .
Ac@@ cor@@ ding to Her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , after 18 years the fam@@ ine wasn &apos;t getting better , so the king decided they would play one final di@@ ce game .
They divi@@ ded the entire k@@ ing@@ dom in half .
They played one di@@ ce game , and the win@@ ners of that game got to go on an epi@@ c ad@@ venture .
They would leave L@@ y@@ dia , and they would go out in search of a new place to live , leaving behind just enough people to survive on the resources that were available , and hopefully to take their civilization somewhere else where they could th@@ ri@@ ve .
Now , this sounds crazy , right ?
But recently , DNA evidence has shown that the E@@ tr@@ us@@ c@@ ans , who then led to the Rom@@ an E@@ mp@@ ire , actually share the same DNA as the ancient L@@ y@@ di@@ ans .
And so , recently , scientists have sugges@@ ted that Her@@ od@@ ot@@ us &apos; crazy story is actually true .
And ge@@ o@@ logists have found evidence of a global co@@ ol@@ ing that las@@ ted for nearly 20 years , that could have expl@@ ained the fam@@ ine .
So this crazy story might be true .
They might have actually saved their culture by playing games , es@@ cap@@ ing to games for 18 years , and then been so inspired , and knew so much about how to come together with games , that they actually saved the entire civilization that way .
Okay , we can do that .
We &apos;ve been playing War@@ craft since 199@@ 4 .
That was the first re@@ al-@@ time strategy game from the World of War@@ craft series .
That was 16 years ago .
They played di@@ ce games for 18 years , we &apos;ve been playing War@@ craft for 16 years .
I say we are ready for our own epi@@ c game .
Now , they had half the civilization go off in search of a new world , so that &apos;s where I get my 21 billion hours a week of gam@@ e-@@ play from .
Let &apos;s get half of us to agree to spend an hour a day playing games , until we solve re@@ al-@@ world problems .
Now , I know you &apos;re asking , &quot; How are we going to solve re@@ al-@@ world problems in games ? &quot;
Well , that &apos;s what I &apos;ve dev@@ ot@@ ed my work to over the past few years , at the Institute for the F@@ u@@ ture .
We have this b@@ ann@@ er in our off@@ ices in Pal@@ o Al@@ to , and it ex@@ pr@@ esses our view of how we should try to rel@@ ate to the future .
We do not want to try to predict the future .
What we want to do is make the future .
We want to imagine the bes@@ t-@@ case scen@@ ario out@@ come , and then we want to em@@ power people to make that out@@ come a reality .
We want to imagine epi@@ c w@@ ins , and then give people the means to achieve the epi@@ c win .
I &apos;m just going to very bri@@ e@@ fly show you three games that I &apos;ve made that are an attemp@@ t to give people the means to create epi@@ c w@@ ins in their own fu@@ tures .
This is World Wi@@ th@@ out O@@ il .
We made this game in 2007 .
This is an online game in which you try to survive an oil shor@@ t@@ age .
The oil shor@@ t@@ age is fic@@ tional , but we put enough online content out there for you to believe that it &apos;s real , and to live your real life as if we &apos;ve run out of oil .
So when you come to the game , you sign up , tell us where you live , and then we give you re@@ al-@@ time news videos , data fe@@ eds that show you exactly how much oil costs , what &apos;s not available , how food supply is being affected , how transport@@ ation is being affected , if schools are closed , if there &apos;s ri@@ oting , and you have to figure out how you would live your real life
as if this were true . And then we ask you to blog about it , to pos@@ t videos , to pos@@ t photos .
We pil@@ ot@@ ed this game with 1,@@ 700 players in 2007 , and we &apos;ve trac@@ ked them for the three years since .
And I can tell you that this is a transform@@ ative experience .
No@@ body wants to change how they live , just because it &apos;s good for the world , or because we &apos;re supposed to .
But if you immer@@ se them in an epi@@ c ad@@ venture and tell them , &quot; We &apos;ve run out of oil .
This is an amazing story and ad@@ venture for you to go on .
Ch@@ all@@ enge yourself to see how you would survive , &quot; most of our players have kept up the hab@@ its that they learned in this game .
So for the next worl@@ d-@@ saving game , we decided to ai@@ m higher -- bigger problem than just pea@@ k oil .
We did a game called Su@@ per@@ struc@@ t at the Institute for the F@@ u@@ ture .
And the pre@@ mise was , a super@@ computer has calcul@@ ated that humans have only 23 years left on the planet .
This super@@ computer was called the Global Ex@@ t@@ inc@@ tion A@@ war@@ eness Sy@@ stem , of course .
We asked people to come online -- almost like a Jer@@ ry B@@ ru@@ ck@@ he@@ im@@ er movie .
You know Jer@@ ry B@@ ru@@ ck@@ he@@ im@@ er movies , you form a dream team -- you &apos;ve got the astr@@ on@@ aut , the scientist , the ex@@ -@@ convic@@ t , and they all have something to do to save the world .
But in our game , instead of just having five people on the dream team , we said , &quot; Everybody &apos;s on the dream team , and it &apos;s your job to invent the future of energy , the future of food , the future of health , the future of security and the future of the social safety net . &quot;
We had 8@@ ,000 people play that game for eight weeks .
They came up with 500 in@@ san@@ ely creative solutions that you can go online , Google &quot; Su@@ per@@ struc@@ t , &quot; and see .
So , finally , the last game , we &apos;re laun@@ ching it Mar@@ ch 3@@ r@@ d . This is a game done with the World Bank Institute .
If you complete the game , you will be cer@@ ti@@ fied by the World Bank Institute as a Soci@@ al In@@ nov@@ ator , class of 2010 .
Wor@@ king with univer@@ si@@ ties all over sub-@@ Sahar@@ an Africa , and we are inv@@ iting them to learn social innovation skills .
We &apos;ve got a graphi@@ c nov@@ el , we &apos;ve got lev@@ eling up in skills like local insi@@ ght , knowledge net@@ working , sustain@@ ability , vision and res@@ our@@ ce@@ ful@@ ness .
I would like to invite all of you to please share this game with young people , anywhere in the world , particularly in developing areas , who might benefit from coming together to try to start to imagine their own social enter@@ prises to save the world .
So , I &apos;m going to w@@ ra@@ p up now .
I want to ask a question .
What do you think happens next ?
We &apos;ve got all these amazing gam@@ ers , we &apos;ve got these games that are kind of pil@@ ots of what we might do , but none of them have saved the real world yet .
Well I hope you will agree with me that gam@@ ers are a human resource that we can use to do re@@ al-@@ world work , that games are a powerful platform for change .
We have all these amazing super@@ po@@ wers : bl@@ iss@@ ful produc@@ tivity , the ability to we@@ ave a ti@@ ght social fabri@@ c , this feeling of ur@@ gent optimis@@ m and the desire for epi@@ c meaning .
I really hope that we can come together to play games that matter , to survive on this planet for another century .
That &apos;s my hope , that you will join me in making and playing games like this .
When I look forward to the next decade , I know two things for sure : that we can make any future we can imagine , and we can play any games we want , so I say : Let the worl@@ d-@@ changing games begin .
Thank you .
For some time I have been interested in the plac@@ e@@ bo effect , which might seem like an od@@ d thing for a mag@@ ici@@ an to be interested in , unless you think of it in the terms that I do , which is , &quot; Some@@ thing fa@@ ke is believed in enough by somebody that it becomes something real . &quot;
In other words , su@@ gar p@@ ills have a mea@@ sur@@ able effect in certain kinds of studies , the plac@@ e@@ bo effect , just because the person thinks that what &apos;s happening to them is a pharmaceu@@ tical or some sort of a -- for pain management , for example , if they believe it enough there is a mea@@ sur@@ able effect in the body called the plac@@ e@@ bo effect .
Some@@ thing fa@@ ke becomes something real because of someone &apos;s perception of it .
In order for us to understand each other , I want to start by showing you a ru@@ di@@ ment@@ ary , very simple magic trick .
And I &apos;m going to show you how it works . This is a trick that &apos;s been in every children &apos;s magic book since at least the 195@@ 0s .
I learned it myself from Cu@@ b S@@ c@@ out Mag@@ ic in the 197@@ 0s .
I &apos;ll do it for you , and then I &apos;ll explain it .
And then I &apos;ll explain why I expl@@ ained it .
So , here &apos;s what happens .
The k@@ ni@@ fe , which you can exam@@ ine ; my hand , which you could exam@@ ine .
I &apos;m just going to hold the k@@ ni@@ fe in my f@@ ist like this .
I &apos;ll get my sle@@ eve back .
And to make sure nothing goes up or down my sle@@ eve I &apos;m just going to squ@@ e@@ e@@ ze my wr@@ ist right here .
That way you can see that at no time can anything travel , as long as I &apos;m squ@@ e@@ e@@ zing there nothing can go up or down my sle@@ eve .
And the object of this is quite simple .
I &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully , if all is well , my pure animal mag@@ ne@@ tis@@ m will hold the k@@ ni@@ fe .
In fact it &apos;s held so ti@@ ghtly in place that I can sh@@ ake it , and the k@@ ni@@ fe does not come off .
No@@ thing goes up or down my sle@@ eve , no tric@@ k@@ ery . And you can exam@@ ine everything .
T@@ a-@@ da !
So , this is a trick that I often teach to young children that are interested in magic , because you can learn a great deal about dec@@ e@@ ption by studying this very -- even though it &apos;s a very simple trick metho@@ do@@ log@@ ically .
P@@ rob@@ ably many of you in the room know this trick .
What happens is this .
I hold the k@@ ni@@ fe in my hand .
I say I &apos;m going to gra@@ b hold of my wr@@ ist to make sure nothing goes up or down my sle@@ eve , that is a lie .
The reason I &apos;m holding onto my wr@@ ist is because that &apos;s actually the secret of the illusion .
In a moment when my hand moves from facing you to being away from you , this finger right here , my in@@ de@@ x finger is just going to shift from where it is , to a position poin@@ ting out like this .
N@@ ice one .
Some@@ one who didn &apos;t have a childhood is out there .
So , it goes like this , from here , right .
And as I move around my finger shif@@ ts .
And we could talk about why this is dec@@ ep@@ tive , why you don &apos;t notice there are only three fin@@ gers down here , because the mind , and the way it processes information , it doesn &apos;t count , one , two , three . It groups them .
But that &apos;s not really what this is about . Right ? And then I open my hand up .
Ob@@ vi@@ ously it &apos;s cl@@ inging there , not by animal mag@@ ne@@ tis@@ m , but by ch@@ ic@@ an@@ ery , my in@@ de@@ x finger being there .
And then when I close my finger , same thing , as I move back , this motion kind of co@@ vers the moving back of my finger .
I take this hand away . You give the k@@ ni@@ fe out .
There is a trick you can do for your friends and neighb@@ ors . Thanks .
Now , what does that have to do with the plac@@ e@@ bo effect ?
I read a study a year or so ago that really ble@@ w my mind wide open .
I &apos;m not a doctor or a resear@@ cher , so this , to me , was an as@@ ton@@ ishing thing .
It turns out that if you ad@@ min@@ ister a plac@@ e@@ bo in the form of a white p@@ ill , that &apos;s like aspir@@ in shap@@ ed -- it &apos;s just a round white p@@ ill -- it has some certain mea@@ sur@@ able effect .
But if you change the form that you give the plac@@ e@@ bo in , like you make a smaller p@@ ill , and color it blue , and st@@ amp a letter into it , it is actually mea@@ sur@@ ably more effective .
Even though ne@@ ither one of these things has any pharmaceu@@ tical -- they &apos;re su@@ gar p@@ ills .
But a white p@@ ill is not as good as a blue p@@ ill .
What ? That really fli@@ pped me out .
Tur@@ ns out though , that that &apos;s not even where it stop@@ s .
If you have cap@@ su@@ les , they &apos;re more effective than tab@@ lets in any form .
A colo@@ red cap@@ su@@ le , that &apos;s yellow on one end and red on the other is better than a white cap@@ su@@ le .
D@@ os@@ age has something to do with this .
One p@@ ill twice a day is not as good at three p@@ ills -- I don &apos;t remember the stati@@ stic now . S@@ or@@ ry .
But the point is ...
... these do@@ s@@ ages have something to do with it .
And the form has something to do with it .
And if you want the ul@@ timate in plac@@ e@@ bo , you &apos;ve go to the nee@@ dle .
Right ? A sy@@ r@@ in@@ ge with some in@@ ert -- a couple C@@ C@@ s of some in@@ ert something , and you inj@@ ect this into a patient ...
Well this is such a powerful image in their mind , it &apos;s so much strong@@ er than the white p@@ ill .
It &apos;s a really , this graph , well I &apos;ll show it to you some other time when we have sli@@ des .
The point is the white p@@ ill is not as good as the blue p@@ ill is not as good as the cap@@ su@@ le is not as good as the nee@@ dle .
And none of it has any real pharmaceu@@ tical quality , it &apos;s only your belief that makes it real in your body and makes a strong@@ er effect .
I wanted to see if I could take that idea and apply it to a magic trick .
And take something that is obviously a fa@@ ke trick and make it seem real .
And we know from that study that when you want reality , you go to the nee@@ dle .
This is a s@@ even@@ -@@ in@@ ch h@@ at@@ p@@ in . It &apos;s very , very shar@@ p , and I &apos;m going to just ster@@ ili@@ ze it a tiny bit .
This is really my fl@@ esh . This is not D@@ am@@ ian &apos;s speci@@ al-@@ grown fl@@ esh .
That &apos;s my skin right there . This is not a Hollywood special effect .
I &apos;m going to pi@@ er@@ ce my skin and run this nee@@ dle through to the other side .
If you &apos;re qu@@ easy -- if you f@@ aint easily -- I was doing this for some friends in the hot@@ el room last night , and some people that I didn &apos;t know , and one woman almost passed out .
So , I suggest if you get qu@@ easy easy that you look away for about the next 30 -- in fact , you know what , I &apos;ll do the first bad part behind it .
You &apos;ll get to see , you can look away too if you &apos;d like to .
So , here is what happens , right here , the beginning of my fl@@ esh at the lower part of my arm I just make a little pi@@ er@@ ce .
I &apos;m sorry , man . A@@ m I fre@@ aking you out ?
OK , and then just through my skin a tiny bit , and then out the other side like this .
Now , essentially we &apos;re in the same position we were in with the k@@ ni@@ fe trick .
S@@ ort of .
But you can &apos;t count my fin@@ gers right now can you ?
So , let me show them to you . That &apos;s one , two three , four , five .
Yes , well ...
I know what people think when they see this .
They go , &quot; Well , he &apos;s certainly not du@@ m@@ b enough to st@@ ab himself through the skin to entert@@ ain us for a few minutes .
So , let me give you a little pe@@ ek .
How &apos;s that look out there ? P@@ ret@@ ty good .
Yeah , I know . And the people in the back go , &quot; OK , I didn &apos;t really see that . &quot;
People in the satellite room are starting to move in now .
Let me give you good close look at this .
That really is my skin . That is not a Hollywood special effect .
That &apos;s my fl@@ esh , and I can tw@@ ist that around .
I &apos;m sorry . If you &apos;re getting qu@@ easy , look away , don &apos;t look at the thing .
People in the back or people on video years from now watching this will go , &quot; Well yeah , that looks kind of ne@@ at in some sort of effect there , but if it were real he would be -- see there &apos;s a hole there and a hole there , if it were real he would be ble@@ eding .
Well let me work up some blood for you .
Yes , there it is .
Nor@@ m@@ ally now , I would take the nee@@ dle out .
I would clean off my arm , and I would show you that there are no w@@ ounds .
But I think in this context and with the idea of taking something fa@@ ke and making it into something real , I &apos;m just going to leave it there , and walk off the stage .
I will be seeing you several times over the next few days .
I hope you &apos;re looking forward to that . Thank you very much .
So , I &apos;ve known a lot of fish in my life .
I &apos;ve loved only two .
That first one , it was more like a passionate aff@@ air .
It was a beautiful fish : fl@@ av@@ or@@ ful , tex@@ tured , me@@ at@@ y , a bes@@ t@@ sel@@ ler on the men@@ u .
What a fish .
Even better , it was farm@@ -@@ raised to the supposed highest standards of sustain@@ ability .
So you could feel good about selling it .
I was in a relationship with this beauty for several months .
One day , the head of the company called and asked if I &apos;d speak at an event about the farm &apos;s sustain@@ ability .
&quot; Ab@@ solu@@ tely , &quot; I said .
Here was a company trying to solve what &apos;s become this un@@ imagin@@ able problem for us chefs : How do we keep fish on our men@@ us ?
For the past 50 years , we &apos;ve been fishing the se@@ as like we clear@@ -@@ cut forests .
It &apos;s hard to over@@ state the destruction .
N@@ in@@ ety percent of large fish , the ones we love -- the tun@@ as , the h@@ ali@@ bu@@ ts , the sal@@ mons , s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish -- they &apos;ve collap@@ sed .
There &apos;s almost nothing left .
So , for better or for worse , aqu@@ ac@@ ul@@ ture , fish farm@@ ing , is going to be a part of our future .
A lot of arguments against it : F@@ ish far@@ ms pollu@@ te -- most of them do anyway -- and they &apos;re in@@ efficient . Take tun@@ a , a major dra@@ w@@ back .
It &apos;s got a feed con@@ version rati@@ o of 15 to one .
That means it takes fi@@ f@@ te@@ en pounds of wild fish to get you one pou@@ nd of farm tun@@ a .
Not very sustainable .
It doesn &apos;t tas@@ te very good either .
So here , finally , was a company trying to do it right .
I wanted to support them .
The day before the event , I called the head of P@@ .@@ R@@ . for the company .
Let &apos;s call him Don .
&quot; Don , &quot; I said , &quot; just to get the facts straight , you guys are famous for farm@@ ing so far out to sea , you don &apos;t pollu@@ te . &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s right , &quot; he said . &quot; We &apos;re so far out , the waste from our fish gets distribu@@ ted , not concentr@@ ated . &quot;
And then he ad@@ ded , &quot; We &apos;re basically a world un@@ to ourselves .
That feed con@@ version rati@@ o ? 2.@@ 5 to one , &quot; he said .
&quot; B@@ est in the business . &quot;
2.@@ 5 to one , great .
&quot; 2.@@ 5 what ? What are you fe@@ eding ? &quot;
&quot; Su@@ st@@ ain@@ able prot@@ e@@ ins , &quot; he said .
&quot; Great , &quot; I said . G@@ ot off the phone .
And that night , I was lying in bed , and I thought : What the hell is a sustainable protein ?
So the next day , just before the event , I called Don .
I said , &quot; Don , what are some examples of sustainable prot@@ e@@ ins ? &quot;
He said he didn &apos;t know . He would ask around .
Well , I got on the phone with a few people in the company ; no one could give me a straight answer until finally , I got on the phone with the head bio@@ logist .
Let &apos;s call him Don too .
&quot; Don , &quot; I said , &quot; what are some examples of sustainable prot@@ e@@ ins ? &quot;
Well , he mentioned some al@@ ga@@ es and some fish me@@ als , and then he said ch@@ ic@@ ken pel@@ lets .
I said , &quot; Chic@@ ken pel@@ lets ? &quot;
He said , &quot; Yeah , f@@ ea@@ thers , skin , bone me@@ al , scr@@ aps , dri@@ ed and proc@@ essed into feed . &quot;
I said , &quot; What per@@ centage of your feed is ch@@ ic@@ ken ? &quot;
Th@@ inking , you know , two percent .
&quot; Well , it &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
I said , &quot; Don , what &apos;s sustainable about fe@@ eding ch@@ ic@@ ken to fish ? &quot;
There was a long pause on the line , and he said , &quot; There &apos;s just too much ch@@ ic@@ ken in the world . &quot;
I fell out of love with this fish .
No , not because I &apos;m some self-@@ ri@@ gh@@ te@@ ous , go@@ o@@ dy@@ -@@ two shoes fo@@ o@@ die .
I actually am .
No , I actually fell out of love with this fish because , I sw@@ ear to God , after that conversation , the fish tas@@ ted like ch@@ ic@@ ken .
This second fish , it &apos;s a different kind of love story .
It &apos;s the roman@@ tic kind , the kind where the more you get to know your fish , you love the fish .
I first ate it at a restaurant in sou@@ thern S@@ pain .
A journalis@@ t friend had been talking about this fish for a long time .
She kind of set us up .
It came to the table a bright , almost sh@@ immer@@ ing , white color .
The chef had over@@ coo@@ ked it .
Like twice over .
Amaz@@ ingly , it was still del@@ ici@@ ous .
Who can make a fish tas@@ te good after it &apos;s been over@@ coo@@ ked ?
I can &apos;t , but this guy can .
Let &apos;s call him M@@ ig@@ u@@ el -- actually his name is M@@ ig@@ u@@ el .
And no , he didn &apos;t co@@ ok the fish , and he &apos;s not a chef , at least in the way that you and I understand it .
He &apos;s a bio@@ logist at V@@ et@@ a La Pal@@ ma .
It &apos;s a fish farm in the sou@@ th@@ w@@ estern corner of S@@ pain .
It &apos;s at the ti@@ p of the Gu@@ ad@@ al@@ qui@@ vi@@ r river .
Un@@ til the 198@@ 0s , the farm was in the hands of the Ar@@ gent@@ ini@@ ans .
They raised be@@ ef cat@@ tle on what was essentially w@@ et@@ lands .
They did it by dr@@ aining the land .
They built this in@@ tric@@ ate series of can@@ als , and they push@@ ed water off the land and out into the river .
Well , they couldn &apos;t make it work , not econom@@ ically .
And eco@@ log@@ ically , it was a disaster .
It killed like 90 percent of the birds , which , for this place , is a lot of birds .
And so in 198@@ 2 , a S@@ pan@@ ish company with an environmental conscience pur@@ ch@@ ased the land .
What did they do ?
They re@@ vers@@ ed the flow of water .
They literally fli@@ pped the switch .
Instead of push@@ ing water out , they used the ch@@ ann@@ els to pull water back in .
They f@@ loo@@ ded the can@@ als .
They created a 2@@ 7@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ ac@@ re fish farm -- bas@@ s , mul@@ let , sh@@ ri@@ mp , e@@ el -- and in the process , M@@ ig@@ u@@ el and this company completely re@@ vers@@ ed the eco@@ logical destruction .
The farm &apos;s incredible .
I mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
You st@@ are out at a horiz@@ on that is a million miles away , and all you see are f@@ loo@@ ded can@@ als and this th@@ ick , rich mar@@ sh@@ land .
I was there not long ago with M@@ ig@@ u@@ el .
He &apos;s an amazing guy , like three parts Charles Darwin and one part Cro@@ co@@ di@@ le D@@ un@@ de@@ e .
Okay ? There we are s@@ log@@ ging through the w@@ et@@ lands , and I &apos;m pan@@ ting and swe@@ ating , got mu@@ d up to my k@@ ne@@ es , and M@@ ig@@ u@@ el &apos;s cal@@ m@@ ly conduc@@ ting a biology lecture .
Here , he &apos;s poin@@ ting out a rare Bl@@ ack@@ -@@ shoul@@ der@@ ed K@@ ite .
Now , he &apos;s menti@@ oning the min@@ eral needs of ph@@ y@@ to@@ plan@@ k@@ ton .
And here , here he sees a grou@@ ping pattern that re@@ minds him of the T@@ anz@@ an@@ ian G@@ ir@@ aff@@ e .
It turns out , M@@ ig@@ u@@ el spent the better part of his career in the Mi@@ k@@ um@@ i National Park in Africa .
I asked him how he became such an expert on fish .
He said , &quot; F@@ ish ? I didn &apos;t know anything about fish .
I &apos;m an expert in relationships . &quot;
And then he &apos;s off , laun@@ ching into more talk about rare birds and al@@ ga@@ es and strange aqu@@ atic plants .
And don &apos;t get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the bio@@ tic community un@@ plu@@ gg@@ ed , kind of thing .
It &apos;s great , but I was in love .
And my head was sw@@ o@@ oning over that over@@ coo@@ ked piece of del@@ ici@@ ous fish I had the night before .
So I inter@@ rup@@ ted him . I said , &quot; M@@ ig@@ u@@ el , what makes your fish tas@@ te so good ? &quot;
He poin@@ ted at the al@@ ga@@ e .
&quot; I know , du@@ de , the al@@ ga@@ e , the ph@@ y@@ to@@ plan@@ k@@ ton , the relationships : It &apos;s amazing .
But what are your fish eating ?
What &apos;s the feed con@@ version rati@@ o ? &quot;
Well , he goes on to tell me it &apos;s such a rich system that the fish are eating what they &apos;d be eating in the wild .
The plant biom@@ ass , the ph@@ y@@ to@@ plan@@ k@@ ton , the z@@ oo@@ plan@@ k@@ ton , it &apos;s what fe@@ eds the fish .
The system is so healthy , it &apos;s totally self-@@ ren@@ e@@ wing .
There is no feed .
E@@ ver heard of a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals ?
L@@ ater that day , I was driving around this property with M@@ ig@@ u@@ el , and I asked him , I said , &quot; For a place that seems so natural , un@@ like like any farm I &apos;d ever been at , how do you measure success ? &quot;
At that moment , it was as if a film direc@@ tor called for a set change .
And we r@@ ounded the corner and saw the most amazing sight : thousands and thousands of p@@ ink fl@@ amin@@ go@@ s , a liter@@ al p@@ ink car@@ p@@ et for as far as you could see .
&quot; That &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
&quot; Look at their bel@@ lies , p@@ ink .
They &apos;re fe@@ as@@ ting . &quot;
F@@ eas@@ ting ? I was totally conf@@ used .
I said , &quot; M@@ ig@@ u@@ el , aren &apos;t they fe@@ as@@ ting on your fish ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , &quot; he said .
&quot; We lose 20 percent of our fish and fish eg@@ gs to birds .
Well , last year , this property had 6@@ 00,000 birds on it , more than 250 different species .
It &apos;s become , today , the largest and one of the most important private bird s@@ anc@@ tu@@ aries in all of Europe . &quot;
I said , &quot; M@@ ig@@ u@@ el , isn &apos;t a th@@ ri@@ ving bird population like the last thing you want on a fish farm ? &quot;
He sho@@ ok his head , no .
He said , &quot; We farm ex@@ ten@@ sively , not inten@@ sively .
This is an eco@@ logical network .
The fl@@ amin@@ go@@ s eat the sh@@ ri@@ mp .
The sh@@ ri@@ mp eat the ph@@ y@@ to@@ plan@@ k@@ ton .
So the pin@@ ker the bel@@ ly , the better the system . &quot;
Okay , so let &apos;s re@@ view : a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals , and a farm that mea@@ sures its success on the health of its pre@@ dat@@ ors .
A fish farm , but also a bird s@@ anc@@ tu@@ ary .
Oh , and by the way , those fl@@ amin@@ go@@ s , they shouldn &apos;t even be there in the first place .
They bro@@ od in a town 150 miles away , where the soil conditions are better for building n@@ ests .
Every morning , they fly 150 miles into the farm .
And every even@@ ing , they fly 150 miles back .
They do that because they &apos;re able to follow the broken white line of high@@ way A@@ 9@@ 2 .
No kid@@ ding .
I was imagin@@ ing a &quot; Mar@@ ch of the Pen@@ gu@@ ins &quot; thing , so I looked at M@@ ig@@ u@@ el .
I said , &quot; M@@ ig@@ u@@ el , do they fly 150 miles to the farm , and then do they fly 150 miles back at night ?
Do they do that for the children ? &quot;
He looked at me like I had just quot@@ ed a Whit@@ ney Hou@@ ston song .
He said , &quot; No ; they do it because the food &apos;s better . &quot;
I didn &apos;t mention the skin of my bel@@ o@@ ved fish , which was del@@ ici@@ ous -- and I don &apos;t like fish skin ; I don &apos;t like it sear@@ ed , I don &apos;t like it cris@@ p@@ y .
It &apos;s that ac@@ rid , tar@@ -@@ like fl@@ av@@ or .
I almost never co@@ ok with it .
Yet , when I tas@@ ted it at that restaurant in sou@@ thern S@@ pain , it tas@@ ted not at all like fish skin .
It tas@@ ted swe@@ et and clean , like you were taking a b@@ ite of the ocean .
I mentioned that to M@@ ig@@ u@@ el , and he no@@ d@@ ded .
He said , &quot; The skin acts like a spon@@ ge .
It &apos;s the last de@@ fense before anything ent@@ ers the body .
It evolved to so@@ ak up im@@ pu@@ ri@@ ties . &quot;
And then he ad@@ ded , &quot; But our water has no im@@ pu@@ ri@@ ties . &quot;
OK . A farm that doesn &apos;t feed its fish , a farm that mea@@ sures its success by the success of its pre@@ dat@@ ors .
And then I realized when he says , &quot; A farm that has no im@@ pu@@ ri@@ ties , &quot; he made a big underst@@ at@@ ement , because the water that flo@@ ws through that farm comes in from the Gu@@ ad@@ al@@ qui@@ vi@@ r Ri@@ ver .
It &apos;s a river that car@@ ries with it all the things that ri@@ vers tend to carry these days : chemical cont@@ amin@@ ants , p@@ esti@@ cide ru@@ no@@ ff .
And when it works its way through the system and leaves , the water is clean@@ er than when it ent@@ ered .
The system is so healthy , it pu@@ ri@@ fi@@ es the water .
So , not just a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals , not just a farm that mea@@ sures its success by the health of its pre@@ dat@@ ors , but a farm that &apos;s literally a water pu@@ ri@@ fication plant -- and not just for those fish , but for you and me as well .
Because when that water leaves , it du@@ m@@ ps out into the Atlan@@ tic .
A drop in the ocean , I know , but I &apos;ll take it , and so should you , because this love story , how@@ ever roman@@ tic , is also instruc@@ tive .
You might say it &apos;s a reci@@ pe for the future of good food , whether we &apos;re talking about bas@@ s or be@@ ef cat@@ tle .
What we need now is a radic@@ ally new conception of agriculture , one in which the food actually tas@@ tes good .
But for a lot people , that &apos;s a bit too radical .
We &apos;re not re@@ alis@@ ts , us fo@@ o@@ dies ; we &apos;re lo@@ vers .
We love farmers &apos; markets , we love small family far@@ ms , we talk about local food , we eat organic .
And when you suggest these are the things that will en@@ sure the future of good food , someone , somewhere st@@ ands up and says , &quot; Hey guy , I love p@@ ink fl@@ amin@@ go@@ s , but how are you going to feed the world ? &quot;
How are you going to feed the world ?
Can I be honest ?
I don &apos;t love that question .
No , not because we already produce enough cal@@ ories to more than feed the world .
One billion people will go hun@@ gry today .
One billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of gro@@ ss in@@ equ@@ alities in distribution , not t@@ onn@@ age .
Now , I don &apos;t love this question because it &apos;s determin@@ ed the logic of our food system for the last 50 years .
Fe@@ ed grain to her@@ bi@@ v@@ or@@ es , p@@ esti@@ ci@@ des to mon@@ o@@ cultures , chemicals to soil , ch@@ ic@@ ken to fish , and all along agri@@ business has simply asked , &quot; If we &apos;re fe@@ eding more people more chea@@ ply , how terrible could that be ? &quot;
That &apos;s been the motivation , it &apos;s been the justi@@ fication : it &apos;s been the business plan of American agriculture .
We should call it what it is : a business in li@@ qu@@ id@@ ation , a business that &apos;s quickly ero@@ ding eco@@ logical capital that makes that very production possible .
That &apos;s not a business , and it isn &apos;t agriculture .
Our bre@@ ad@@ bas@@ ket is threat@@ en@@ ed today , not because of dimin@@ ishing supply , but because of dimin@@ ishing resources .
Not by the lat@@ est combine and tr@@ actor invention , but by fer@@ tile land ; not by pu@@ m@@ ps , but by fresh water ; not by ch@@ ain@@ sa@@ ws , but by forests ; and not by fishing bo@@ ats and nets , but by fish in the sea .
W@@ ant to feed the world ?
Let &apos;s start by asking : How are we going to feed ourselves ?
Or better : How can we create conditions that en@@ able every community to feed itself ?
To do that , don &apos;t look at the agri@@ business model for the future .
It &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s ti@@ red .
It &apos;s high on capital , chemistry and machines , and it &apos;s never produced anything really good to eat .
Instead , let &apos;s look to the eco@@ logical model .
That &apos;s the one that reli@@ es on two billion years of on-@@ the@@ -@@ job experience .
Look to M@@ ig@@ u@@ el , farmers like M@@ ig@@ u@@ el .
F@@ arms that aren &apos;t worlds un@@ to themselves ; far@@ ms that res@@ to@@ re instead of de@@ ple@@ te ; far@@ ms that farm ex@@ ten@@ sively instead of just inten@@ sively ; farmers that are not just produc@@ ers , but experts in relationships .
Because they &apos;re the ones that are experts in fl@@ av@@ or , too .
And if I &apos;m going to be really honest , they &apos;re a better chef than I &apos;ll ever be .
You know , I &apos;m okay with that , because if that &apos;s the future of good food , it &apos;s going to be del@@ ici@@ ous .
Thank you .
I grew up on a stea@@ dy di@@ et of science fiction .
In high school , I took a bus to school an hour each way every day .
And I was always absor@@ bed in a book , science fiction book , which took my mind to other worlds , and satis@@ fied , in a narrative form , this ins@@ ati@@ able sense of curios@@ ity that I had .
And you know , that curios@@ ity also manifes@@ ted itself in the fact that whenever I wasn &apos;t in school I was out in the woo@@ ds , hi@@ king and taking &quot; sam@@ ples &quot; -- fro@@ gs and sn@@ akes and bu@@ gs and pond water -- and bringing it back , looking at it under the microscope .
You know , I was a real science ge@@ ek .
But it was all about trying to understand the world , understand the lim@@ its of possibility .
And my love of science fiction actually seemed mir@@ ro@@ red in the world around me , because what was happening , this was in the late &apos; 6@@ 0s , we were going to the moon , we were explor@@ ing the deep oceans .
J@@ ac@@ ques C@@ ou@@ st@@ eau was coming into our living rooms with his amazing speci@@ als that showed us animals and places and a won@@ dr@@ ous world that we could never really have previ@@ ously imagin@@ ed .
So , that seemed to res@@ on@@ ate with the whole science fiction part of it .
And I was an artist .
I could draw . I could paint .
And I found that because there weren &apos;t video games and this s@@ atur@@ ation of C@@ G movies and all of this imag@@ ery in the media landscape , I had to create these images in my head .
You know , we all did , as kids having to read a book , and through the auth@@ or &apos;s descri@@ ption , put something on the movie screen in our heads .
And so , my response to this was to paint , to draw alien creatures , alien worlds , robots , spac@@ es@@ hi@@ ps , all that stuff .
I was end@@ less@@ ly getting bu@@ st@@ ed in math class do@@ od@@ ling behind the t@@ ext@@ book .
That was -- the creativity had to find its out@@ let somehow .
And an interesting thing happened : The J@@ ac@@ ques C@@ ou@@ st@@ eau shows actually got me very excited about the fact that there was an alien world right here on Earth .
I might not really go to an alien world on a spac@@ es@@ hi@@ p some@@ day -- that seemed pretty dar@@ n un@@ likely .
But that was a world I could really go to , right here on Earth , that was as rich and exo@@ tic as anything that I had imagin@@ ed from reading these books .
So , I decided I was going to become a s@@ cu@@ ba di@@ ver at the age of 15 .
And the only problem with that was that I lived in a little village in Canada , 600 miles from the near@@ est ocean .
But I didn &apos;t let that dau@@ n@@ t me .
I pes@@ tered my father until he finally found a s@@ cu@@ ba class in Bu@@ ff@@ al@@ o , New York , right across the bor@@ der from where we live .
And I actually got cer@@ ti@@ fied in a po@@ ol at a Y@@ M@@ CA in the dead of win@@ ter in Bu@@ ff@@ al@@ o , New York .
And I didn &apos;t see the ocean , a real ocean , for another two years , until we moved to California .
Since then , in the inter@@ ven@@ ing 40 years , I &apos;ve spent about 3,000 hours underwater , and 500 hours of that was in sub@@ mer@@ si@@ bles .
And I &apos;ve learned that that dee@@ p@@ -@@ ocean environment , and even the sh@@ allow oceans , are so rich with amazing life that really is beyond our imagination .
Nature &apos;s imagination is so b@@ ound@@ less compared to our own me@@ ager human imagination .
I still , to this day , stand in absolute a@@ we of what I see when I make these di@@ ves .
And my love aff@@ air with the ocean is on@@ going , and just as strong as it ever was .
But when I chose a career as an adult , it was fil@@ m@@ making .
And that seemed to be the best way to re@@ con@@ ci@@ le this ur@@ ge I had to tell stories with my ur@@ ges to create images .
And I was , as a kid , constantly drawing com@@ ic books , and so on .
So , fil@@ m@@ making was the way to put pictures and stories together , and that made sense .
And of course the stories that I chose to tell were science fiction stories : &quot; Ter@@ min@@ ator , &quot; &quot; A@@ li@@ ens &quot; and &quot; The A@@ by@@ ss . &quot;
And with &quot; The A@@ by@@ ss , &quot; I was putting together my love of underwater and di@@ ving with fil@@ m@@ making .
So , you know , mer@@ ging the two pas@@ sions .
Some@@ thing interesting came out of &quot; The A@@ by@@ ss , &quot; which was that to solve a specific narrative problem on that film , which was to create this kind of liqui@@ d water cre@@ ature , we actually embr@@ ac@@ ed computer gener@@ ated animation , C@@ G .
And this resul@@ ted in the first sof@@ t-@@ surface character , C@@ G animation that was ever in a movie .
And even though the film didn &apos;t make any money -- bar@@ ely broke even , I should say -- I wit@@ n@@ essed something amazing , which is that the audience , the global audience , was mes@@ mer@@ ized by this appar@@ ent magic .
You know , it &apos;s Ar@@ thu@@ r C@@ lar@@ ke &apos;s law that any suff@@ ici@@ ently advanced technology is in@@ distin@@ gu@@ ish@@ able from magic .
They were seeing something mag@@ ical .
And so that got me very excited .
And I thought , &quot; Wow , this is something that needs to be embr@@ ac@@ ed into the cin@@ em@@ atic art . &quot;
So , with &quot; Ter@@ min@@ ator 2 , &quot; which was my next film , we took that much far@@ ther .
Wor@@ king with I@@ L@@ M , we created the liqui@@ d met@@ al du@@ de in that film . The success hun@@ g in the balance on whether that effect would work .
And it did , and we created magic again , and we had the same result with an audience -- although we did make a little more money on that one .
So , drawing a line through those two dots of experience came to , &quot; This is going to be a whole new world , &quot; this was a whole new world of creativity for film artists .
So , I started a company with St@@ an W@@ inst@@ on , my good friend St@@ an W@@ inst@@ on , who is the premi@@ er ma@@ k@@ e-@@ up and cre@@ ature designer at that time , and it was called D@@ ig@@ ital D@@ om@@ ain .
And the concept of the company was that we would le@@ ap@@ fro@@ g past the analo@@ g processes of op@@ tical pr@@ inter@@ s and so on , and we would go right to digital production .
And we actually did that and it gave us a competi@@ tive advantage for a while .
But we found ourselves l@@ ag@@ ging in the mi@@ d &apos; 9@@ 0s in the cre@@ ature and character design stuff that we had actually f@@ ounded the company to do .
So , I wrote this piece called &quot; Av@@ at@@ ar , &quot; which was meant to absolutely push the envelop@@ e of visual effects , of C@@ G effects , beyond , with re@@ alis@@ tic human emo@@ tive characters gener@@ ated in C@@ G , and the main characters would all be in C@@ G , and the world would be in C@@ G .
And the envelop@@ e push@@ ed back , and I was told by the folks at my company that we weren &apos;t going to be able to do this for a while .
So , I shel@@ ved it , and I made this other movie about a big ship that sin@@ ks .
You know , I went and pit@@ ched it to the studio as &quot; &apos; Rom@@ e@@ o and Juli@@ et &apos; on a ship : &quot; It &apos;s going to be this epi@@ c rom@@ ance , passionate film . &quot;
Sec@@ ret@@ ly , what I wanted to do was I wanted to di@@ ve to the real w@@ rec@@ k of &quot; Tit@@ an@@ ic . &quot;
And that &apos;s why I made the movie .
And that &apos;s the truth . Now , the studio didn &apos;t know that .
But I convinced them . I said , &quot; We &apos;re going to di@@ ve to the w@@ rec@@ k . We &apos;re going to film it for real .
We &apos;ll be using it in the opening of the film .
It will be really important . It will be a great marketing ho@@ ok . &quot;
And I talked them into funding an ex@@ pe@@ dition .
S@@ ounds crazy . But this goes back to that them@@ e about your imagination creating a reality .
Because we actually created a reality where six months later , I find myself in a Rus@@ sian sub@@ mer@@ sible two and a half miles down in the nor@@ th Atlan@@ tic , looking at the real Tit@@ an@@ ic through a view port .
Not a movie , not H@@ D -- for real .
Now , that ble@@ w my mind .
And it took a lot of prepar@@ ation , we had to build cameras and lights and all kinds of things .
But , it struc@@ k me how much this di@@ ve , these deep di@@ ves , was like a space mission .
You know , where it was highly technical , and it required enormous planning .
You get in this cap@@ su@@ le , you go down to this dark ho@@ sti@@ le environment where there is no hope of res@@ cue if you can &apos;t get back by yourself .
And I thought like , &quot; Wow . I &apos;m like , living in a science fiction movie .
This is really cool . &quot;
And so , I really got bit@@ ten by the bu@@ g of dee@@ p@@ -@@ ocean exploration .
Of course , the curios@@ ity , the science compon@@ ent of it -- it was everything . It was ad@@ venture , it was curios@@ ity , it was imagination .
And it was an experience that Hollywood couldn &apos;t give me .
Because , you know , I could imagine a cre@@ ature and we could create a visual effect for it . But I couldn &apos;t imagine what I was seeing out that window .
As we did some of our sub@@ se@@ quent ex@@ pe@@ di@@ tions , I was seeing creatures at hydro@@ ther@@ mal v@@ ents and sometimes things that I had never seen before , sometimes things that no one had seen before , that actually were not described by science at the time that we saw them and imag@@ ed them .
So , I was completely sm@@ it@@ ten by this , and had to do more .
And so , I actually made a kind of curious decision .
After the success of &quot; Tit@@ an@@ ic , &quot; I said , &quot; OK , I &apos;m going to park my day job as a Hollywood movie ma@@ ker , and I &apos;m going to go be a ful@@ l@@ -@@ time explorer for a while . &quot;
And so , we started planning these ex@@ pe@@ di@@ tions .
And we w@@ ound up going to the B@@ is@@ mark , and explor@@ ing it with robo@@ tic vehic@@ les .
We went back to the Tit@@ an@@ ic w@@ rec@@ k .
We took little b@@ ots that we had created that spo@@ ol@@ ed a fi@@ ber op@@ tic .
And the idea was to go in and do an inter@@ ior sur@@ vey of that ship , which had never been done .
No@@ body had ever looked inside the w@@ rec@@ k . They didn &apos;t have the means to do it , so we created technology to do it .
So , you know , here I am now , on the dec@@ k of Tit@@ an@@ ic , sitting in a sub@@ mer@@ sible , and looking out at plan@@ ks that look much like this , where I knew that the band had played .
And I &apos;m flying a little robo@@ tic vehicle through the cor@@ ri@@ d@@ or of the ship .
When I say , &quot; I &apos;m operating it , &quot; but my mind is in the vehicle .
I felt like I was physi@@ cally present inside the shi@@ p@@ w@@ rec@@ k of Tit@@ an@@ ic .
And it was the most sur@@ real kind of de@@ j@@ a v@@ u experience I &apos;ve ever had , because I would know before I turned a corner what was going to be there before the lights of the vehicle actually reve@@ aled it , because I had walked the set for months when we were making the movie .
And the set was based as an exact replic@@ a on the blu@@ e@@ prin@@ ts of the ship .
So , it was this absolutely remarkable experience .
And it really made me realize that the tele@@ pres@@ ence experience -- that you actually can have these robo@@ tic av@@ at@@ ars , then your consciousness is inj@@ ected into the vehicle , into this other form of existence .
It was really , really quite profound .
And it may be a little bit of a g@@ lim@@ p@@ se as to what might be happening some decades out as we start to have cy@@ bor@@ g bodies for exploration or for other means in many sort of post-@@ human fu@@ tures that I can imagine , as a science fiction fan .
So , having done these ex@@ pe@@ di@@ tions , and really beginning to appreci@@ ate what was down there , such as at the deep ocean v@@ ents where we had these amazing , amazing animals -- they &apos;re basically ali@@ ens right here on Earth .
They live in an environment of chem@@ o@@ syn@@ thesis .
They don &apos;t survive on sun@@ li@@ ght-@@ based system the way we do .
And so , you &apos;re seeing animals that are living next to a 5@@ 0@@ 0-@@ de@@ gre@@ e-@@ C@@ enti@@ grade water plu@@ mes .
You think they can &apos;t possibly exist .
At the same time I was getting very interested in space science as well -- again , it &apos;s the science fiction influence , as a kid .
And I w@@ ound up getting involved with the space community , really involved with NASA , sitting on the NASA ad@@ vis@@ ory board , planning actual space mis@@ sions , going to Rus@@ sia , going through the pre-@@ cos@@ mon@@ aut biom@@ e@@ dic@@ al prot@@ oc@@ ols , and all these sorts of things , to actually go and fly to the international space station with our 3D camera systems .
And this was fascinating .
But what I w@@ ound up doing was bringing space scientists with us into the deep .
And taking them down so that they had access -- as@@ tro@@ bio@@ logists , plan@@ et@@ ary scientists , people who were interested in these extreme environments -- taking them down to the v@@ ents , and l@@ etting them see , and take sam@@ ples and test instruments , and so on .
So , here we were making document@@ ary films , but actually doing science , and actually doing space science .
I &apos;d completely closed the loo@@ p between being the science fiction fan , you know , as a kid , and doing this stuff for real .
And you know , along the way in this journey of discovery , I learned a lot .
I learned a lot about science . But I also learned a lot about leadership .
Now you think direc@@ tor has got to be a leader , leader of , cap@@ t@@ ain of the ship , and all that sort of thing .
I didn &apos;t really learn about leadership until I did these ex@@ pe@@ di@@ tions .
Because I had to , at a certain point , say , &quot; What am I doing out here ?
Why am I doing this ? What do I get out of it ? &quot;
We don &apos;t make money at these dam@@ n shows .
We bar@@ ely break even . There is no f@@ ame in it .
People sort of think I went away between &quot; Tit@@ an@@ ic &quot; and &quot; Av@@ at@@ ar &quot; and was bu@@ ff@@ ing my n@@ ails some@@ place , sitting at the be@@ ach .
M@@ ade all these films , made all these document@@ ary films for a very limited audience .
No f@@ ame , no gl@@ ory , no money . What are you doing ?
You &apos;re doing it for the task itself , for the challenge -- and the ocean is the most challeng@@ ing environment there is -- for the thr@@ ill of discovery , and for that strange bon@@ d that happens when a small group of people form a ti@@ ghtly k@@ n@@ it team .
Because we would do these things with 10 , 12 people , working for years at a time , sometimes at sea for two , three months at a time .
And in that bon@@ d , you realize that the most important thing is the respect that you have for them and that they have for you , that you &apos;ve done a task that you can &apos;t explain to someone else .
When you come back to the sho@@ re and you say , &quot; We had to do this , and the fi@@ ber op@@ tic , and the atten@@ tu@@ ation , and the this and the that , all the technology of it , and the difficul@@ ty , the human@@ -@@ performance aspects of working at sea , &quot; you can &apos;t explain it to people . It &apos;s that thing that maybe cop@@ s have , or people in combat that have gone through something together and they know they can never explain it .
C@@ re@@ ates a bon@@ d , creates a bon@@ d of respect .
So , when I came back to make my next movie , which was &quot; Av@@ at@@ ar , &quot; I tried to apply that same principle of leadership , which is that you respect your team , and you ear@@ n their respect in return .
And it really changed the dynamic .
So , here I was again with a small team , in un@@ char@@ ted territ@@ ory , doing &quot; Av@@ at@@ ar , &quot; coming up with new technology that didn &apos;t exist before .
T@@ rem@@ end@@ ously exciting .
T@@ rem@@ end@@ ously challeng@@ ing .
And we became a family , over a four@@ -@@ and-@@ half year period .
And it completely changed how I do movies .
So , people have comm@@ ented on how , &quot; Well , you know , you brought back the ocean organisms and put them on the planet of P@@ and@@ or@@ a . &quot;
To me , it was more of a fundamental way of doing business , the process itself , that changed as a result of that .
So , what can we syn@@ thes@@ ize out of all this ?
You know , what are the lessons learned ?
Well , I think number one is curios@@ ity .
It &apos;s the most powerful thing you own .
Imag@@ ination is a force that can actually manif@@ est a reality .
And the respect of your team is more important than all the lau@@ rels in the world .
I have young fil@@ m@@ ma@@ kers come up to me and say , &quot; G@@ ive me some ad@@ vice for doing this . &quot;
And I say , &quot; Don &apos;t put limit@@ ations on yourself .
O@@ ther people will do that for you -- don &apos;t do it to yourself , don &apos;t bet against yourself , and take risks . &quot;
NASA has this phrase that they like : &quot; Fai@@ lu@@ re is not an option . &quot;
But failure has to be an option in art and in exploration , because it &apos;s a lea@@ p of faith .
And no important end@@ e@@ av@@ or that required innovation was done without risk .
You have to be willing to take those risks .
So , that &apos;s the thought I would leave you with , is that in whatever you &apos;re doing , failure is an option , but fear is not . Thank you .
If I can leave you with one big idea today , it &apos;s that the whole of the data in which we consu@@ me is greater that the sum of the parts , and instead of thinking about information over@@ load , what I &apos;d like you to think about is how we can use information so that patterns pop and we can see tr@@ ends that would otherwise be invisible .
So what we &apos;re looking at right here is a typical mortality ch@@ art organized by age .
This tool that I &apos;m using here is a little experiment .
It &apos;s called Pi@@ vo@@ t , and with Pi@@ vo@@ t what I can do is I can choose to fil@@ ter in one particular cause of dea@@ ths -- say , accidents .
And , right away , I see there &apos;s a different pattern that emerg@@ es .
This is because , in the mi@@ d-@@ area here , people are at their most active , and over here they &apos;re at their most f@@ rai@@ l .
We can step back out again and then re@@ organiz@@ e the data by cause of death , seeing that circul@@ atory diseases and cancer are the usual su@@ spec@@ ts , but not for everyone .
If we go ahead and we fil@@ ter by age -- say 40 years or less -- we see that accidents are actually the greatest cause that people have to be worried about .
And if you dr@@ ill into that , it &apos;s especially the case for men .
So you get the idea that vie@@ wing information , vie@@ wing data in this way , is a lot like swim@@ ming in a living information in@@ fo@@ -@@ graphi@@ c .
And if we can do this for ra@@ w data , why not do it for content as well ?
So what we have right here is the cover of every single S@@ ports I@@ ll@@ ustr@@ ated ever produced .
It &apos;s all here ; it &apos;s all on the web .
You can go back to your rooms and try this after my talk .
With Pi@@ vo@@ t , you can dr@@ ill into a decade .
You can dr@@ ill into a particular year .
You can jump right into a specific issue .
So I &apos;m looking at this ; I see the ath@@ let@@ es that have appeared in this issue , the sports .
I &apos;m a L@@ ance Ar@@ m@@ strong fan , so I &apos;ll go ahead and I &apos;ll click on that , which reve@@ als , for me , all the issues in which L@@ ance Ar@@ m@@ strong &apos;s been a part of .
Now , if I want to just kind of take a pe@@ ek at these , I might think , &quot; Well , what about taking a look at all of cy@@ cl@@ ing ? &quot;
So I can step back , and exp@@ and on that .
And I see Gre@@ g Le@@ M@@ ond now .
And so you get the idea that when you navig@@ ate over information this way -- going nar@@ ro@@ wer , broad@@ er , b@@ acking in , b@@ acking out -- you &apos;re not se@@ arch@@ ing , you &apos;re not bro@@ w@@ sing .
You &apos;re doing something that &apos;s actually a little bit different .
It &apos;s in between , and we think it changes the way information can be used .
So I want to extra@@ pol@@ ate on this idea a bit with something that &apos;s a little bit crazy .
What we &apos;re done here is we &apos;ve taken every single Wikipedia page and we re@@ duced it down to a little sum@@ mar@@ y .
So the sum@@ mar@@ y cons@@ ists of just a little sy@@ no@@ p@@ sis and an ic@@ on to indic@@ ate the top@@ ical area that it comes from .
I &apos;m only showing the top 500 most popular Wikipedia pages right here .
But even in this limited view , we can do a lot of things .
Right away , we get a sense of what are the top@@ ical dom@@ ains that are most popular on Wikipedia .
I &apos;m going to go ahead and sel@@ ect government .
Now , having sel@@ ected government , I can now see that the Wikipedia categ@@ ories that most frequ@@ ently correspond to that are Ti@@ me magazine People of the Y@@ ear .
So this is really important because this is an insi@@ ght that was not cont@@ ained within any one Wikipedia page .
It &apos;s only possible to see that insi@@ ght when you step back and look at all of them .
L@@ oo@@ king at one of these particular sum@@ mar@@ ies , I can then dr@@ ill into the concept of Ti@@ me magazine Per@@ son of the Y@@ ear , bringing up all of them .
So looking at these people , I can see that the majority come from government ; some have come from natural sciences ; some , fe@@ wer still , have come from business -- there &apos;s my bo@@ ss -- and one has come from music .
And inter@@ est@@ ingly enough , Bon@@ o is also a TED Pri@@ ze win@@ ner .
So we can go , jump , and take a look at all the TED Pri@@ ze win@@ ners .
So you see , we &apos;re navig@@ ating the web for the first time as if it &apos;s actually a web , not from p@@ ag@@ e-@@ to-@@ page , but at a higher level of abstr@@ action .
And so I want to show you one other thing that may catch you a little bit by surprise .
I &apos;m just showing the New York Times website here .
So Pi@@ vo@@ t , this application -- I don &apos;t want to call it a bro@@ w@@ ser ; it &apos;s really not a bro@@ w@@ ser , but you can view web pages with it -- and we bring that zo@@ om@@ able technology to every single web page like this .
So I can step back , pop right back into a specific section .
Now the reason why this is important is because , by virtu@@ e of just vie@@ wing web pages in this way , I can look at my entire bro@@ w@@ sing history in the exact same way .
So I can dr@@ ill into what I &apos;ve done over specific time fr@@ ames .
Here , in fact , is the state of all the dem@@ o that I just gave .
And I can sort of re@@ play some stuff that I was looking at earlier today .
And , if I want to step back and look at everything , I can sli@@ ce and di@@ ce my history , perhaps by my search history -- here , I was doing some ne@@ po@@ ti@@ stic se@@ arch@@ ing , looking for B@@ ing , over here for Li@@ ve L@@ ab@@ s Pi@@ vo@@ t .
And from these , I can dr@@ ill into the web page and just laun@@ ch them again .
It &apos;s one metaphor re@@ pur@@ posed multiple times , and in each case it makes the whole greater than the sum of the parts with the data .
So right now , in this world , we think about data as being this cur@@ se .
We talk about the cur@@ se of information over@@ load .
We talk about dro@@ w@@ ning in data .
What if we can actually turn that up@@ side down and turn the web up@@ side down , so that instead of navig@@ ating from one thing to the next , we get used to the hab@@ it of being able to go from many things to many things , and then being able to see the patterns that were otherwise hidden ?
If we can do that , then instead of being tr@@ apped in data , we might actually extr@@ act information .
And , instead of dealing just with information , we can tea@@ se out knowledge .
And if we get the knowledge , then maybe even there &apos;s wisdom to be found .
So with that , I thank you .
Everybody talks about happiness these days .
I had somebody count the number of books with &quot; happiness &quot; in the ti@@ tle published in the last five years and they gave up after about 40 , and there were many more .
There is a huge wave of interest in happiness , among researchers .
There is a lot of happiness co@@ ach@@ ing .
Everybody would like to make people happ@@ ier .
But in sp@@ ite of all this f@@ loo@@ d of work , there are several cognitive tr@@ aps that sort of make it almost impossible to think straight about happiness .
And my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive tr@@ aps .
This appli@@ es to lay@@ people thinking about their own happiness , and it appli@@ es to sch@@ ol@@ ars thinking about happiness , because it turns out we &apos;re just as mess@@ ed up as anybody else is .
The first of these tr@@ aps is a re@@ lu@@ c@@ t@@ ance to ad@@ mit complexity .
It turns out that the word &quot; happiness &quot; is just not a useful word anymore , because we apply it to too many different things .
I think there is one particular meaning to which we might restric@@ t it , but by and large , this is something that we &apos;ll have to give up and we &apos;ll have to adop@@ t the more complicated view of what well-@@ being is .
The second tra@@ p is a con@@ fusion between experience and memory ; basically , it &apos;s between being happy in your life , and being happy about your life or happy with your life .
And those are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both lu@@ mp@@ ed in the notion of happiness .
And the third is the foc@@ using illusion , and it &apos;s the un@@ fortun@@ ate fact that we can &apos;t think about any circumst@@ ance that aff@@ ects well-@@ being without dist@@ or@@ ting its importance .
I mean , this is a real cognitive tra@@ p .
There &apos;s just no way of getting it right .
Now , I &apos;d like to start with an example of somebody who had a ques@@ ti@@ on-@@ and-@@ answer s@@ ession after one of my lec@@ tures re@@ ported a story , and that was a story -- He said he &apos;d been listening to a sym@@ ph@@ ony , and it was absolutely gl@@ ori@@ ous music and at the very end of the recor@@ ding , there was a dre@@ ad@@ ful scre@@ e@@ ching sound .
And then he ad@@ ded , really quite emo@@ tion@@ ally , it ru@@ ined the whole experience .
But it hadn &apos;t .
What it had ru@@ ined were the mem@@ ories of the experience .
He had had the experience .
He had had 20 minutes of gl@@ ori@@ ous music .
They coun@@ ted for nothing because he was left with a memory ; the memory was ru@@ ined , and the memory was all that he had gotten to keep .
What this is telling us , really , is that we might be thinking of ourselves and of other people in terms of two selves .
There is an experi@@ encing self , who lives in the present and knows the present , is capable of re-@@ living the past , but basically it has only the present .
It &apos;s the experi@@ encing self that the doctor appro@@ aches -- you know , when the doctor asks , &quot; Does it hur@@ t now when I touch you here ? &quot;
And then there is a rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ing self , and the rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ing self is the one that kee@@ ps score , and ma@@ int@@ ains the story of our life , and it &apos;s the one that the doctor appro@@ aches in asking the question , &quot; How have you been feeling l@@ ately ? &quot;
or &quot; How was your trip to Al@@ ban@@ ia ? &quot; or something like that .
Those are two very different enti@@ ties , the experi@@ encing self and the rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ing self , and getting conf@@ used between them is part of the m@@ ess about the notion of happiness .
Now , the rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ing self is a stor@@ y@@ tel@@ ler .
And that really starts with a basic response of our mem@@ ories -- it starts immediately .
We don &apos;t only tell stories when we set out to tell stories .
Our memory tells us stories , that is , what we get to keep from our experiences is a story .
And let me begin with one example .
This is an old study .
Those are actual patients under@@ going a pain@@ ful proce@@ dure .
I won &apos;t go into detail . It &apos;s no longer pain@@ ful these days , but it was pain@@ ful when this study was run in the 199@@ 0s .
They were asked to report on their pain every 60 seconds .
Here are two patients , those are their recor@@ dings .
And you are asked , &quot; Who of them suff@@ ered more ? &quot;
And it &apos;s a very easy question .
C@@ lear@@ ly , P@@ ati@@ ent B suff@@ ered more -- his colon@@ o@@ sc@@ opy was longer , and every minute of pain that P@@ ati@@ ent A had , P@@ ati@@ ent B had , and more .
But now there is another question : &quot; How much did these patients think they suff@@ ered ? &quot;
And here is a surprise .
The surprise is that P@@ ati@@ ent A had a much worse memory of the colon@@ o@@ sc@@ opy than P@@ ati@@ ent B .
The stories of the colon@@ o@@ sc@@ op@@ ies were different , and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends .
And ne@@ ither of these stories is very inspir@@ ing or great -- but one of them is this distinc@@ t ... but one of them is distinc@@ tly worse than the other .
And the one that is worse is the one where pain was at its pea@@ k at the very end ; it &apos;s a bad story .
How do we know that ?
Because we asked these people after their colon@@ o@@ sc@@ opy , and much later , too , &quot; How bad was the whole thing , in total ? &quot;
And it was much worse for A than for B , in memory .
Now this is a direct conflict between the experi@@ encing self and the rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ing self .
From the point of view of the experi@@ encing self , clearly , B had a worse time .
Now , what you could do with P@@ ati@@ ent A , and we actually ran clinical experiments , and it has been done , and it does work -- you could actually ex@@ tend the colon@@ o@@ sc@@ opy of P@@ ati@@ ent A by just keeping the tube in without j@@ ig@@ gl@@ ing it too much .
That will cause the patient to suff@@ er , but just a little and much less than before .
And if you do that for a couple of minutes , you have made the experi@@ encing self of P@@ ati@@ ent A worse off , and you have the rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ing self of P@@ ati@@ ent A a lot better off , because now you have end@@ ow@@ ed P@@ ati@@ ent A with a better story about his experience .
What defin@@ es a story ?
And that is true of the stories that memory deli@@ vers for us , and it &apos;s also true of the stories that we make up .
What defin@@ es a story are changes , significant moments and end@@ ings .
En@@ dings are very , very important and , in this case , the ending domin@@ ated .
Now , the experi@@ encing self lives its life continu@@ ously .
It has moments of experience , one after the other .
And you can ask : What happens to these moments ?
And the answer is really strai@@ ght@@ forward : They are lost forever .
I mean , most of the moments of our life -- and I calcul@@ ated , you know , the psycho@@ logical present is said to be about three seconds long ; that means that , you know , in a life there are about 600 million of them ; in a month , there are about 6@@ 00,000 -- most of them don &apos;t leave a trace .
Most of them are completely igno@@ red by the rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ing self .
And yet , somehow you get the sense that they should count , that what happens during these moments of experience is our life .
It &apos;s the fin@@ ite resource that we &apos;re spending while we &apos;re on this earth .
And how to spend it would seem to be relevant , but that is not the story that the rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ing self kee@@ ps for us .
So we have the rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ing self and the experi@@ encing self , and they &apos;re really quite distinc@@ t .
The biggest difference between them is in the hand@@ ling of time .
From the point of view of the experi@@ encing self , if you have a vac@@ ation , and the second week is just as good as the first , then the two-@@ week vac@@ ation is twice as good as the one-@@ week vac@@ ation .
That &apos;s not the way it works at all for the rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ing self .
For the rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ing self , a two-@@ week vac@@ ation is bar@@ ely better than the one-@@ week vac@@ ation because there are no new mem@@ ories ad@@ ded .
You have not changed the story .
And in this way , time is actually the critical vari@@ able that distin@@ gu@@ ish@@ es a rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ing self from an experi@@ encing self ; time has very little impact on the story .
Now , the rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ing self does more than remember and tell stories .
It is actually the one that makes decisions because , if you have a patient who has had , say , two colon@@ o@@ sc@@ op@@ ies with two different surge@@ ons and is dec@@ id@@ ing which of them to choose , then the one that cho@@ o@@ ses is the one that has the memory that is less bad , and that &apos;s the surge@@ on that will be cho@@ sen .
The experi@@ encing self has no voice in this choice .
We actually don &apos;t choose between experiences , we choose between mem@@ ories of experiences .
And even when we think about the future , we don &apos;t think of our future normally as experiences .
We think of our future as anticip@@ ated mem@@ ories .
And basically you can look at this , you know , as a ty@@ r@@ anny of the rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ing self , and you can think of the rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ing self sort of drag@@ ging the experi@@ encing self through experiences that the experi@@ encing self doesn &apos;t need .
I have that sense that when we go on vac@@ ations this is very frequ@@ ently the case ; that is , we go on vac@@ ations , to a very large ex@@ tent , in the service of our rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ing self .
And this is a bit hard to justi@@ fy I think .
I mean , how much do we consu@@ me our mem@@ ories ?
That is one of the explan@@ ations that is given for the domin@@ ance of the rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ing self .
And when I think about that , I think about a vac@@ ation we had in Antarc@@ tic@@ a a few years ago , which was clearly the best vac@@ ation I &apos;ve ever had , and I think of it relatively often , relative to how much I think of other vac@@ ations .
And I probably have consum@@ ed my mem@@ ories of that three-@@ week trip , I would say , for about 25 minutes in the last four years .
Now , if I had ever opened the fol@@ der with the 600 pictures in it , I would have spent another hour .
Now , that is three weeks , and that is at most an hour and a half .
There seems to be a dis@@ cre@@ p@@ ancy .
Now , I may be a bit extreme , you know , in how little ap@@ petite I have for consum@@ ing mem@@ ories , but even if you do more of this , there is a gen@@ u@@ ine question : Why do we put so much weight on memory relative to the weight that we put on experiences ?
So I want you to think about a thought experiment .
Imagine that for your next vac@@ ation , you know that at the end of the vac@@ ation all your pictures will be destro@@ yed , and you &apos;ll get an am@@ n@@ es@@ ic drug so that you won &apos;t remember anything .
Now , would you choose the same vac@@ ation ? And if you would choose a different vac@@ ation , there is a conflict between your two selves , and you need to think about how to ad@@ ju@@ dic@@ ate that conflict , and it &apos;s actually not at all obvious , because if you think in terms of time , then you get one answer , and if you think in terms of mem@@ ories , you might get another answer .
Why do we pick the vac@@ ations we do is a problem that confron@@ ts us with a choice between the two selves .
Now , the two selves bring up two no@@ tions of happiness .
There are really two concepts of happiness that we can apply , one per self .
So you can ask : How happy is the experi@@ encing self ?
And then you would ask : How happy are the moments in the experi@@ encing self &apos;s life ?
And they &apos;re all -- happiness for moments is a fairly complicated process .
What are the emotions that can be measu@@ red ?
And , by the way , now we are capable of getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experi@@ encing self over time .
If you ask for the happiness of the rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ing self , it &apos;s a completely different thing .
This is not about how happ@@ ily a person lives .
It is about how satis@@ fied or pl@@ eas@@ ed the person is when that person thinks about her life .
Very different notion .
Any@@ one who doesn &apos;t distin@@ gu@@ ish those no@@ tions is going to m@@ ess up the study of happiness , and I bel@@ ong to a crow@@ d of students of well-@@ being , who &apos;ve been mess@@ ing up the study of happiness for a long time in precis@@ ely this way .
The distinc@@ tion between the happiness of the experi@@ encing self and the satis@@ fac@@ tion of the rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ing self has been recogni@@ zed in recent years , and there are now efforts to measure the two separ@@ ately .
The G@@ all@@ up Or@@ gan@@ ization has a world po@@ ll where more than half a million people have been asked questions about what they think of their life and about their experiences , and there have been other efforts along those lines .
So in recent years , we have beg@@ un to learn about the happiness of the two selves .
And the main lesson I think that we have learned is they are really different .
You can know how satis@@ fied somebody is with their life , and that really doesn &apos;t teach you much about how happ@@ ily they &apos;re living their life , and vice vers@@ a .
Just to give you a sense of the cor@@ relation , the cor@@ relation is about .@@ 5 .
What that means is if you met somebody , and you were told , &quot; Oh his father is six feet t@@ all , &quot; how much would you know about his he@@ ight ?
Well , you would know something about his he@@ ight , but there &apos;s a lot of un@@ certain@@ ty .
You have that much un@@ certain@@ ty .
If I tell you that somebody ran@@ ked their life eight on a scale of ten , you have a lot of un@@ certain@@ ty about how happy they are with their experi@@ encing self .
So the cor@@ relation is low .
We know something about what contr@@ ols satis@@ fac@@ tion of the happiness self .
We know that money is very important , goals are very important .
We know that happiness is main@@ ly being satis@@ fied with people that we like , spending time with people that we like .
There are other plea@@ sures , but this is domin@@ ant .
So if you want to maxim@@ ize the happiness of the two selves , you are going to end up doing very different things .
The bottom line of what I &apos;ve said here is that we really should not think of happiness as a sub@@ stitu@@ te for well-@@ being .
It is a completely different notion .
Now , very quickly , another reason we cannot think straight about happiness is that we do not attend to the same things when we think about life , and we actually live .
So , if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in California , you are not going to get to the correct answer .
When you ask that question , you think people must be happ@@ ier in California if , say , you live in O@@ hi@@ o .
And what happens is when you think about living in California , you are thinking of the contr@@ ast between California and other places , and that contr@@ ast , say , is in climate .
Well , it turns out that climate is not very important to the experi@@ encing self and it &apos;s not even very important to the refl@@ ective self that dec@@ ides how happy people are .
But now , because the refl@@ ective self is in charge , you may end up -- some people may end up moving to California .
And it &apos;s sort of interesting to trace what is going to happen to people who move to California in the hope of getting happ@@ ier .
Well , their experi@@ encing self is not going to get happ@@ ier .
We know that .
But one thing will happen : They will think they are happ@@ ier , because , when they think about it , they &apos;ll be re@@ min@@ ded of how horrible the weather was in O@@ hi@@ o , and they will feel they made the right decision .
It is very difficult to think straight about well-@@ being , and I hope I have given you a sense of how difficult it is .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : Thank you . I &apos;ve got a question for you .
Thank you so much .
Now , when we were on the phone a few weeks ago , you mentioned to me that there was quite an interesting result came out of that G@@ all@@ up sur@@ vey .
Is that something you can share since you do have a few moments left now ?
D@@ aniel K@@ ah@@ n@@ em@@ an : Su@@ re .
I think the most interesting result that we found in the G@@ all@@ up sur@@ vey is a number , which we absolutely did not expect to find .
We found that with respect to the happiness of the experi@@ encing self .
When we looked at how feelings , v@@ ary with income .
And it turns out that , below an income of 6@@ 0,000 dollars a year , for Americans -- and that &apos;s a very large sam@@ ple of Americans , like 6@@ 00,000 , so it &apos;s a large repres@@ ent@@ ative sam@@ ple -- below an income of 6@@ 00,000 dollars a year ...
CA : 6@@ 0,000 .
D@@ K : 6@@ 0,000 .
6@@ 0,000 dollars a year , people are un@@ happy , and they get progr@@ essi@@ vely un@@ happ@@ ier the po@@ orer they get .
A@@ bo@@ ve that , we get an absolutely fl@@ at line .
I mean I &apos;ve rar@@ ely seen lines so fl@@ at .
C@@ lear@@ ly , what is happening is money does not buy you experi@@ enti@@ al happiness , but lack of money certainly bu@@ ys you mis@@ ery , and we can measure that mis@@ ery very , very clearly .
In terms of the other self , the rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ing self , you get a different story .
The more money you ear@@ n , the more satis@@ fied you are .
That does not hold for emotions .
CA : But D@@ anny , the whole American end@@ e@@ av@@ or is about life , liber@@ ty , the pur@@ suit of happiness .
If people took seriously that finding , I mean , it seems to turn up@@ side down everything we believe about , like for example , tax@@ ation policy and so forth .
Is there any chance that politicians , that the country gener@@ ally , would take a finding like that seriously and run public policy based on it ?
D@@ K : You know I think that there is recogni@@ tion of the role of happiness research in public policy .
The recogni@@ tion is going to be slow in the United States , no question about that , but in the U.@@ K. , it is happening , and in other countries it is happening .
People are recogni@@ zing that they ought to be thinking of happiness when they think of public policy .
It &apos;s going to take a while , and people are going to debate whether they want to study experience happiness , or whether they want to study life ev@@ alu@@ ation , so we need to have that debate fairly soon .
How to en@@ h@@ ance happiness goes very different ways depend@@ ing on how you think , and whether you think of the rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ing self or you think of the experi@@ encing self .
This is going to influence policy , I think , in years to come .
In the United States , efforts are being made to measure the experience happiness of the population .
This is going to be , I think , within the next decade or two , part of national statistics .
CA : Well , it seems to me that this issue will -- or at least should be -- the most interesting policy discussion to track over the next few years .
Thank you so much for invent@@ ing behavi@@ oral economics .
Thank you , D@@ anny K@@ ah@@ n@@ em@@ an .
I &apos;m going to talk today about energy and climate .
And that might seem a bit surprising because my ful@@ l@@ -@@ time work at the F@@ oundation is mostly about vacc@@ ines and see@@ ds , about the things that we need to invent and deliver to help the po@@ or@@ est two billion live better lives .
But energy and climate are extremely important to these people -- in fact , more important than to anyone else on the planet .
The climate getting worse means that many years , their cro@@ ps won &apos;t grow : There will be too much rain , not enough rain , things will change in ways that their frag@@ ile environment simply can &apos;t support .
And that leads to star@@ vation , it leads to un@@ certain@@ ty , it leads to un@@ rest .
So , the climate changes will be terrible for them .
Al@@ so , the price of energy is very important to them .
In fact , if you could pick just one thing to lower the price of , to reduce poverty , by far you would pick energy .
Now , the price of energy has come down over time .
Re@@ ally advanced civilization is based on adv@@ ances in energy .
The coal revolution fu@@ eled the In@@ d@@ us@@ trial R@@ evolution , and , even in the 19@@ 0@@ 0s we &apos;ve seen a very rap@@ id dec@@ line in the price of electricity , and that &apos;s why we have re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators , air@@ -@@ condi@@ tioning , we can make modern materials and do so many things .
And so , we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
But , as we make it che@@ aper -- and let &apos;s go for making it twice as cheap -- we need to meet a new con@@ str@@ aint , and that con@@ str@@ aint has to do with CO2 .
CO2 is warming the planet , and the equ@@ ation on CO2 is actually a very strai@@ ght@@ forward one .
If you sum up the CO2 that gets em@@ it@@ ted , that leads to a temperature increase , and that temperature increase leads to some very negative effects : the effects on the weather ; perhaps worse , the indi@@ rec@@ t effects , in that the natural eco@@ systems can &apos;t ad@@ just to these rap@@ id changes , and so you get eco@@ system collap@@ ses .
Now , the exact amount of how you map from a certain increase of CO2 to what temperature will be and where the positive feed@@ b@@ acks are , there &apos;s some un@@ certain@@ ty there , but not very much .
And there &apos;s certainly un@@ certain@@ ty about how bad those effects will be , but they will be extremely bad .
I asked the top scientists on this several times : Do we really have to get down to near zero ?
Can &apos;t we just cut it in half or a quar@@ ter ?
And the answer is that until we get near to zero , the temperature will continue to rise .
And so that &apos;s a big challenge .
It &apos;s very different than saying &quot; We &apos;re a tw@@ el@@ ve-@@ foot@@ -@@ high truc@@ k trying to get under a ten@@ -@@ foot bridge , and we can just sort of squ@@ e@@ e@@ ze under . &quot;
This is something that has to get to zero .
Now , we put out a lot of carbon di@@ ox@@ ide every year , over 26 billion tons .
For each American , it &apos;s about 20 tons ; for people in poor countries , it &apos;s less than one ton .
It &apos;s an average of about five tons for everyone on the planet .
And , somehow , we have to make changes that will bring that down to zero .
It &apos;s been constantly going up .
It &apos;s only various economic changes that have even fl@@ atten@@ ed it at all , so we have to go from rapidly ris@@ ing to fall@@ ing , and fall@@ ing all the way to zero .
This equ@@ ation has four factors , a little bit of multi@@ plic@@ ation : So , you &apos;ve got a thing on the left , CO2 , that you want to get to zero , and that &apos;s going to be based on the number of people , the services each person &apos;s using on average , the energy on average for each service , and the CO2 being put out per unit of energy .
So , let &apos;s look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to zero .
P@@ rob@@ ably , one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero .
Now that &apos;s back from high school al@@ ge@@ br@@ a , but let &apos;s take a look .
First , we &apos;ve got population .
The world today has 6@@ .@@ 8 billion people .
That &apos;s hea@@ ded up to about nine billion .
Now , if we do a really great job on new vacc@@ ines , health care , re@@ productive health services , we could lower that by , perhaps , 10 or 15 percent , but there we see an increase of about 1.@@ 3 .
The second fac@@ tor is the services we use .
This en@@ compas@@ ses everything : the food we eat , clo@@ thing , TV , he@@ ating .
These are very good things : getting rid of poverty means provi@@ ding these services to almost everyone on the planet .
And it &apos;s a great thing for this number to go up .
In the rich world , perhaps the top one billion , we probably could cut back and use less , but every year , this number , on average , is going to go up , and so , over all , that will more than double the services deli@@ vered per person .
Here we have a very basic service : Do you have li@@ ghting in your house to be able to read your hom@@ ework ?
And , in fact , these kids don &apos;t , so they &apos;re going out and reading their school work under the street lam@@ ps .
Now , effici@@ ency , E , the energy for each service , here finally we have some good news .
We have something that &apos;s not going up .
Th@@ r@@ ough various inv@@ enti@@ ons and new ways of doing li@@ ghting , through different types of cars , different ways of building buildings -- there are a lot of services where you can bring the energy for that service down quite subst@@ anti@@ ally .
Some individual services even bring it down by 90 percent .
There are other services like how we make fer@@ ti@@ liz@@ er , or how we do air transport , where the rooms for impro@@ vement are far , far less .
And so , over@@ all here , if we &apos;re optimis@@ tic , we may get a re@@ duction of a fac@@ tor of three to even , perhaps , a fac@@ tor of six .
But for these first three factors now , we &apos;ve gone from 26 billion to , at best , maybe 13 billion tons , and that just won &apos;t cut it .
So let &apos;s look at this fourth fac@@ tor -- this is going to be a key one -- and this is the amount of CO2 put out per each unit of energy .
And so the question is : Can you actually get that to zero ?
If you bur@@ n coal , no .
If you bur@@ n natural gas , no .
Al@@ most every way we make electricity today , except for the emerging ren@@ ew@@ ables and nuclear , puts out CO2 .
And so , what we &apos;re going to have to do at a global scale , is create a new system .
And so , we need energy mirac@@ les .
Now , when I use the term &quot; miracle , &quot; I don &apos;t mean something that &apos;s impossible .
The micro@@ proc@@ essor is a miracle . The personal computer is a miracle .
The Internet and its services are a miracle .
So , the people here have particip@@ ated in the creation of many mirac@@ les .
U@@ su@@ ally , we don &apos;t have a dea@@ d@@ line , where you have to get the miracle by a certain date .
U@@ su@@ ally , you just kind of stand by , and some come along , some don &apos;t .
This is a case where we actually have to drive at full speed and get a miracle in a pretty ti@@ ght tim@@ el@@ ine .
Now , I thought , &quot; How could I really capture this ?
Is there some kind of natural illustr@@ ation , some demonstr@@ ation that would gra@@ b people &apos;s imagination here ? &quot;
I thought back to a year ago when I brought mo@@ squ@@ it@@ os , and somehow people enjo@@ yed that .
It really got them involved in the idea of , you know , there are people who live with mo@@ squ@@ it@@ os .
So , with energy , all I could come up with is this .
I decided that rele@@ as@@ ing fi@@ ref@@ lies would be my contribu@@ tion to the environment here this year .
So here we have some natural fi@@ ref@@ lies .
I &apos;m told they don &apos;t b@@ ite ; in fact , they might not even leave that j@@ ar .
Now , there &apos;s all sorts of g@@ imm@@ ick@@ y solutions like that one , but they don &apos;t really add up to much .
We need solutions -- either one or several -- that have un@@ believ@@ able scale and un@@ believ@@ able reli@@ ability , and , although there &apos;s many directions people are see@@ king , I really only see five that can achieve the big numbers .
I &apos;ve left out ti@@ de , ge@@ other@@ mal , fusion , bio@@ fu@@ els .
Those may make some contribu@@ tion , and if they can do better than I expect , so much the better , but my key point here is that we &apos;re going to have to work on each of these five , and we can &apos;t give up any of them because they look dau@@ n@@ ting , because they all have significant challenges .
Let &apos;s look first at the bur@@ ning fossi@@ l fu@@ els , either bur@@ ning coal or bur@@ ning natural gas .
What you need to do there , seems like it might be simple , but it &apos;s not , and that &apos;s to take all the CO2 , after you &apos;ve bur@@ ned it , going out the flu@@ e , pres@@ su@@ ri@@ ze it , create a liqui@@ d , put it somewhere , and hope it st@@ ays there .
Now we have some pil@@ ot things that do this at the 60 to 80 percent level , but getting up to that full per@@ centage , that will be very tric@@ ky , and agre@@ e@@ ing on where these CO2 quanti@@ ties should be put will be hard , but the tou@@ gh@@ est one here is this long-term issue .
Who &apos;s going to be sure ?
Who &apos;s going to gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ e something that is literally billions of times larger than any type of waste you think of in terms of nuclear or other things ?
This is a lot of volume .
So that &apos;s a tough one .
N@@ ext would be nuclear .
It also has three big problems : Co@@ st , particularly in highly regul@@ ated countries , is high ; the issue of the safety , really feeling good about nothing could go wrong , that , even though you have these human oper@@ ators , that the fuel doesn &apos;t get used for weapons .
And then what do you do with the waste ?
And , although it &apos;s not very large , there are a lot of concer@@ ns about that .
People need to feel good about it .
So three very tough problems that might be sol@@ v@@ able , and so , should be worked on .
The last three of the five , I &apos;ve grou@@ ped together .
These are what people often re@@ fer to as the ren@@ ew@@ able sources .
And they actually -- although it &apos;s great they don &apos;t require fuel -- they have some dis@@ adv@@ antages .
One is that the den@@ sity of energy gath@@ ered in these technologies is dram@@ atically less than a power plant .
This is energy farm@@ ing , so you &apos;re talking about many square miles , thousands of time more area than you think of as a normal energy plant .
Al@@ so , these are inter@@ mit@@ tent sources .
The sun doesn &apos;t sh@@ ine all day , it doesn &apos;t sh@@ ine every day , and , li@@ ke@@ wise , the wind doesn &apos;t b@@ low all the time .
And so , if you de@@ pend on these sources , you have to have some way of getting the energy during those time peri@@ ods that it &apos;s not available .
So , we &apos;ve got big cost challenges here , we have transmission challenges : for example , say this energy source is outside your country ; you not only need the technology , but you have to deal with the risk of the energy coming from el@@ se@@ where .
And , finally , this stor@@ age problem .
And , to dimen@@ sion@@ alize this , I went through and looked at all the types of batter@@ ies that get made -- for cars , for computers , for phones , for fl@@ ash@@ lights , for everything -- and compared that to the amount of electrical energy the world uses , and what I found is that all the batter@@ ies we make now could store less than 10 minutes of all the energy .
And so , in fact , we need a big break@@ through here , something that &apos;s going to be a fac@@ tor of 100 better than the appro@@ aches we have now .
It &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not a very easy thing .
Now , this shows up when you try to get the inter@@ mit@@ tent source to be above , say , 20 to 30 percent of what you &apos;re using .
If you &apos;re coun@@ ting on it for 100 percent , you need an incredible miracle battery .
Now , how we &apos;re going to go forward on this -- what &apos;s the right approach ?
Is it a Manhattan Project ? What &apos;s the thing that can get us there ?
Well , we need lots of companies working on this , hundreds .
In each of these five path@@ s , we need at least a hundred people .
And a lot of them , you &apos;ll look at and say , &quot; They &apos;re crazy . &quot; That &apos;s good .
And , I think , here in the TED group , we have many people who are already pur@@ su@@ ing this .
Bill Gro@@ ss has several companies , including one called e@@ Sol@@ ar that has some great solar ther@@ mal technologies .
V@@ in@@ od K@@ ho@@ s@@ la &apos;s inv@@ esting in do@@ z@@ ens of companies that are doing great things and have interesting possibilities , and I &apos;m trying to help back that .
N@@ athan My@@ h@@ r@@ vol@@ d and I actually are b@@ acking a company that , perhaps surpris@@ ingly , is actually taking the nuclear approach .
There are some innovations in nuclear : mod@@ ular , liqui@@ d .
And innovation really stopped in this industry quite some ago , so the idea that there &apos;s some good ideas l@@ aying around is not all that surprising .
The idea of Ter@@ ra@@ Po@@ wer is that , instead of bur@@ ning a part of ur@@ ani@@ um -- the one percent , which is the U@@ 2@@ 35 -- we decided , &quot; Let &apos;s bur@@ n the 99 percent , the U@@ 2@@ 3@@ 8 . &quot;
It is kind of a crazy idea .
In fact , people had talked about it for a long time , but they could never simul@@ ate proper@@ ly whether it would work or not , and so it &apos;s through the ad@@ vent of modern super@@ computers that now you can simul@@ ate and see that , yes , with the right material &apos;s approach , this looks like it would work .
And , because you &apos;re bur@@ ning that 99 percent , you have great@@ ly impro@@ ved cost pro@@ file .
You actually bur@@ n up the waste , and you can actually use as fuel all the le@@ f@@ to@@ ver waste from today &apos;s re@@ act@@ ors .
So , instead of wor@@ rying about them , you just take that . It &apos;s a great thing .
It bre@@ ath@@ es this ur@@ ani@@ um as it goes along , so it &apos;s kind of like a c@@ and@@ le .
You can see it &apos;s a lo@@ g there , often refer@@ red to as a trav@@ eling wave re@@ actor .
In terms of fuel , this really sol@@ ves the problem .
I &apos;ve got a picture here of a place in Ken@@ tu@@ cky .
This is the le@@ f@@ to@@ ver , the 99 percent , where they &apos;ve taken out the part they bur@@ n now , so it &apos;s called depl@@ eted ur@@ ani@@ um .
That would power the U.S. for hundreds of years .
And , simply by fil@@ ter@@ ing s@@ ea@@ water in an in@@ expensive process , you &apos;d have enough fuel for the entire lifetime of the rest of the planet .
So , you know , it &apos;s got lots of challenges ahead , but it is an example of the many hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to move forward .
So let &apos;s think : How should we measure ourselves ?
What should our report card look like ?
Well , let &apos;s go out to where we really need to get , and then look at the inter@@ medi@@ ate .
For 20@@ 50 , you &apos;ve heard many people talk about this 80 percent re@@ duction .
That really is very important , that we get there .
And that 20 percent will be used up by things going on in poor countries , still some agriculture , hopefully we will have clean@@ ed up for@@ es@@ try , c@@ ement .
So , to get to that 80 percent , the developed countries , including countries like China , will have had to switch their electricity generation al@@ together .
So , the other grade is : Are we depl@@ o@@ ying this zer@@ o-@@ emis@@ sion technology , have we depl@@ oy@@ ed it in all the developed countries and we &apos;re in the process of getting it el@@ se@@ where ?
That &apos;s super important .
That &apos;s a key el@@ ement of making that report card .
So , b@@ acking up from there , what should the 20@@ 20 report card look like ?
Well , again , it should have the two elements .
We should go through these effici@@ ency mea@@ sures to start getting re@@ duc@@ tions : The less we em@@ it , the less that sum will be of CO2 , and , therefore , the less the temperature .
But in some ways , the grade we get there , doing things that don &apos;t get us all the way to the big re@@ duc@@ tions , is only equ@@ ally , or maybe even slightly less , important than the other , which is the piece of innovation on these break@@ through@@ s .
These break@@ through@@ s , we need to move those at full speed , and we can measure that in terms of companies , pil@@ ot projects , regul@@ atory things that have been changed .
There &apos;s a lot of great books that have been written about this .
The Al Gore book , &quot; Our Ch@@ o@@ ice &quot; and the David Mc@@ K@@ ay book , &quot; Su@@ st@@ ain@@ able En@@ ergy Wi@@ th@@ out the H@@ ot A@@ ir . &quot;
They really go through it and create a fr@@ am@@ ework that this can be discus@@ sed broad@@ ly , because we need bro@@ ad b@@ acking for this .
There &apos;s a lot that has to come together .
So this is a wish .
It &apos;s a very concre@@ te wish that we invent this technology .
If you gave me only one wish for the next 50 years -- I could pick who &apos;s president , I could pick a vacc@@ ine , which is something I love , or I could pick that this thing that &apos;s half the cost with no CO2 gets invented -- this is the wish I would pick .
This is the one with the greatest impact .
If we don &apos;t get this wish , the di@@ vision between the people who think short term and long term will be terrible , between the U.S. and China , between poor countries and rich , and most of all the lives of those two billion will be far worse .
So , what do we have to do ?
What am I appe@@ aling to you to step forward and drive ?
We need to go for more research funding .
When countries get together in places like C@@ open@@ h@@ ag@@ en , they shouldn &apos;t just discus@@ s the CO2 .
They should discus@@ s this innovation ag@@ end@@ a , and you &apos;d be stun@@ ned at the ridi@@ cul@@ ously low levels of spending on these innov@@ ative appro@@ aches .
We do need the market incenti@@ ves -- CO2 ta@@ x , ca@@ p and trade -- something that gets that price signal out there .
We need to get the message out .
We need to have this dialogue be a more rational , more underst@@ and@@ able dialogue , including the steps that the government takes .
This is an important wish , but it is one I think we can achieve .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : Thank you . Thank you .
Thank you . So to understand more about Ter@@ ra@@ Po@@ wer , right -- I mean , first of all , can you give a sense of what scale of investment this is ?
B@@ il Gates : To actually do the software , buy the super@@ computer , h@@ ire all the great scientists , which we &apos;ve done , that &apos;s only tens of millions , and even once we test our materials out in a Rus@@ sian re@@ actor to make sure that our materials work proper@@ ly , then you &apos;ll only be up in the hundreds of millions .
The tough thing is building the pil@@ ot re@@ actor ; finding the several billion , finding the regul@@ ator , the location that will actually build the first one of these .
Once you get the first one built , if it works as adver@@ tis@@ ed , then it &apos;s just clear as day , because the economics , the energy den@@ sity , are so different than nuclear as we know it .
CA : And so , to understand it right , this invol@@ ves building deep into the ground almost like a ver@@ tical kind of col@@ um@@ n of nuclear fuel , of this sort of spent ur@@ ani@@ um , and then the process starts at the top and kind of works down ?
BG : That &apos;s right . Today , you &apos;re always refu@@ eling the re@@ actor , so you have lots of people and lots of contr@@ ols that can go wrong : that thing where you &apos;re opening it up and moving things in and out , that &apos;s not good .
So , if you have very cheap fuel that you can put 60 years in -- just think of it as a lo@@ g -- put it down and not have those same complex@@ i@@ ties .
And it just s@@ its there and bur@@ ns for the 60 years , and then it &apos;s done .
CA : It &apos;s a nuclear power plant that is its own waste dispos@@ al solution .
BG : Yeah . Well , what happens with the waste , you can let it sit there -- there &apos;s a lot less waste under this approach -- then you can actually take that , and put it into another one and bur@@ n that .
And we start off actually by taking the waste that exists today , that &apos;s sitting in these co@@ ol@@ ing po@@ ols or dry cas@@ king by re@@ act@@ ors -- that &apos;s our fuel to begin with .
So , the thing that &apos;s been a problem from those re@@ act@@ ors is actually what gets f@@ ed into ours , and you &apos;re re@@ duc@@ ing the volume of the waste quite dram@@ atically as you &apos;re going through this process .
CA : I mean , you &apos;re talking to different people around the world about the possibilities here .
Where is there most interest in actually doing something with this ?
BG : Well , we haven &apos;t picked a particular place , and there &apos;s all these interesting dis@@ clo@@ sure rules about anything that &apos;s called &quot; nuclear , &quot; so we &apos;ve got a lot of interest , that people from the company have been in Rus@@ sia , India , China -- I &apos;ve been back seeing the sec@@ ret@@ ary of energy here , talking about how this fits into the energy ag@@ end@@ a .
So I &apos;m optimis@@ tic . You know , the French and Japanese have done some work .
This is a vari@@ ant on something that has been done .
It &apos;s an important adv@@ ance , but it &apos;s like a fast re@@ actor , and a lot of countries have built them , so anybody who &apos;s done a fast re@@ actor is a candi@@ date to be where the first one gets built .
CA : So , in your mind , ti@@ mes@@ c@@ ale and lik@@ eli@@ hood of actually taking something like this live ?
BG : Well , we need -- for one of these high-@@ scale , elec@@ tro@@ -@@ generation things that &apos;s very cheap , we have 20 years to invent and then 20 years to depl@@ o@@ y .
That &apos;s sort of the dea@@ d@@ line that the environmental models have shown us that we have to meet .
And , you know , Ter@@ ra@@ Po@@ wer , if things go well -- which is w@@ ishing for a lot -- could easily meet that .
And there are , fortunately now , do@@ z@@ ens of companies -- we need it to be hundreds -- who , li@@ ke@@ wise , if their science goes well , if the funding for their pil@@ ot plants goes well , that they can com@@ pe@@ te for this .
And it &apos;s best if multiple succe@@ ed , because then you could use a mi@@ x of these things .
We certainly need one to succe@@ ed .
CA : In terms of bi@@ g@@ -@@ scale possible game changes , is this the biggest that you &apos;re aware of out there ?
BG : An energy break@@ through is the most important thing .
It would have been , even without the environmental con@@ str@@ aint , but the environmental con@@ str@@ aint just makes it so much greater .
In the nuclear space , there are other innov@@ ators .
You know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as we know this one , but the mod@@ ular people , that &apos;s a different approach .
There &apos;s a li@@ qu@@ id@@ -@@ type re@@ actor , which seems a little hard , but maybe they say that about us .
And so , there are different ones , but the beauty of this is a molecule of ur@@ ani@@ um has a million times as much energy as a molecule of , say , coal , and so -- if you can deal with the neg@@ atives , which are essentially the radiation -- the foot@@ print and cost , the potential , in terms of effect on land and various things , is almost in a class of its own .
CA : If this doesn &apos;t work , then what ?
Do we have to start taking emer@@ gency mea@@ sures to try and keep the temperature of the earth stable ?
BG : If you get into that situation , it &apos;s like if you &apos;ve been over@@ -@@ eating , and you &apos;re about to have a heart attack : Then where do you go ? You may need heart surgery or something .
There is a line of research on what &apos;s called ge@@ o@@ engineering , which are various techniques that would del@@ ay the he@@ ating to buy us 20 or 30 years to get our act together .
Now , that &apos;s just an insur@@ ance policy .
You hope you don &apos;t need to do that .
Some people say you shouldn &apos;t even work on the insur@@ ance policy because it might make you la@@ z@@ y , that you &apos;ll keep eating because you know heart surgery will be there to save you .
I &apos;m not sure that &apos;s wise , given the importance of the problem , but there &apos;s now the ge@@ o@@ engineering discussion about -- should that be in the back po@@ cket in case things happen faster , or this innovation goes a lot s@@ lower than we expect ?
CA : C@@ lim@@ ate s@@ ke@@ p@@ tics : If you had a sentence or two to say to them , how might you persu@@ ade them that they &apos;re wrong ?
BG : Well , unfortunately , the s@@ ke@@ p@@ tics come in different cam@@ ps .
The ones who make scientific arguments are very few .
Are they saying that there &apos;s negative feedback effects that have to do with clou@@ ds that off@@ set things ?
There are very , very few things that they can even say there &apos;s a chance in a million of those things .
The main problem we have here , it &apos;s kind of like AIDS .
You make the mis@@ take now , and you pay for it a lot later .
And so , when you have all sorts of ur@@ gent problems , the idea of taking pain now that has to do with a gain later , and a some@@ what un@@ certain pain thing -- in fact , the I@@ P@@ C@@ C report , that &apos;s not necessarily the worst case , and there are people in the rich world who look at I@@ P@@ C@@ C and say , &quot; OK , that isn &apos;t that big of a deal . &quot;
The fact is it &apos;s that un@@ certain part that should move us towards this .
But my dream here is that , if you can make it economic , and meet the CO2 con@@ str@@ ain@@ ts , then the s@@ ke@@ p@@ tics say , &quot; OK , I don &apos;t care that it doesn &apos;t put out CO2 , I kind of wish it did put out CO2 , but I guess I &apos;ll accept it because it &apos;s che@@ aper than what &apos;s come before . &quot;
CA : And so , that would be your response to the B@@ j@@ or@@ n L@@ omb@@ or@@ g argument , that basically if you spend all this energy trying to solve the CO2 problem , it &apos;s going to take away all your other goals of trying to rid the world of poverty and malaria and so forth , it &apos;s a stupid waste of the Earth &apos;s resources to put money towards that when there are better things we can do .
BG : Well , the actual spending on the R &amp; amp ; D piece -- say the U.S. should spend 10 billion a year more than it is right now -- it &apos;s not that dram@@ atic .
It shouldn &apos;t take away from other things .
The thing you get into big money on , and this , reas@@ on@@ able people can dis@@ agree , is when you have something that &apos;s non-@@ economic and you &apos;re trying to fu@@ nd that -- that , to me , mostly is a waste .
Un@@ less you &apos;re very close and you &apos;re just funding the learning cur@@ ve and it &apos;s going to get very cheap , I believe we should try more things that have a potential to be far less expensive .
If the tra@@ de-@@ off you get into is , &quot; Let &apos;s make energy super expensive , &quot; then the rich can afford that .
I mean , all of us here could pay five times as much for our energy and not change our li@@ fes@@ ty@@ le .
The disaster is for that two billion .
And even L@@ omb@@ or@@ g has changed .
His sh@@ tic@@ k now is , &quot; Why isn &apos;t the R &amp; amp ; D getting more discus@@ sed ? &quot;
He &apos;s still , because of his earlier stuff , still associated with the s@@ ke@@ p@@ tic camp , but he &apos;s realized that &apos;s a pretty lon@@ ely camp , and so , he &apos;s making the R &amp; amp ; D point .
And so there is a th@@ read of something that I think is appropri@@ ate .
The R &amp; amp ; D piece , it &apos;s crazy how little it &apos;s fun@@ ded .
CA : Well Bill , I susp@@ ect I speak on the be@@ half of most people here to say I really hope your wish comes true . Thank you so much .
BG : Thank you .
I &apos;d like to share with you a discovery that I made a few months ago while writing an article for Ital@@ ian Wi@@ red .
I always keep my thes@@ aur@@ us hand@@ y whenever I &apos;m writing anything , but I &apos;d already finished ed@@ iting the piece , and I realized that I had never once in my life looked up the word &quot; dis@@ ab@@ led &quot; to see what I &apos;d find .
Let me read you the en@@ try .
&quot; Dis@@ ab@@ led , ad@@ j@@ ective : crip@@ pl@@ ed , hel@@ pl@@ ess , us@@ eless , w@@ rec@@ ked , st@@ all@@ ed , m@@ aim@@ ed , w@@ ounded , mang@@ led , l@@ ame , mu@@ til@@ ated , run@@ -@@ down , wor@@ n@@ -@@ out , wea@@ k@@ en@@ ed , im@@ po@@ tent , cas@@ tr@@ ated , paraly@@ zed , han@@ dic@@ apped , sen@@ ile , dec@@ rep@@ it , l@@ ai@@ d-@@ up , don@@ e-@@ up , don@@ e-@@ for , don@@ e-@@ in cr@@ ac@@ ke@@ d-@@ up , coun@@ te@@ d-@@ out ; see also hur@@ t , us@@ eless and wea@@ k .
An@@ ton@@ y@@ ms , healthy , strong , capable . &quot;
I was reading this list out l@@ oud to a friend and at first was laugh@@ ing , it was so lu@@ di@@ cr@@ ous , but I &apos;d just gotten past &quot; mang@@ led , &quot; and my voice broke , and I had to stop and collect myself from the emotional shoc@@ k and impact that the ass@@ au@@ lt from these words un@@ le@@ ash@@ ed .
You know , of course , this is my r@@ ag@@ ge@@ dy old thes@@ aur@@ us so I &apos;m thinking this must be an ancient print date , right ?
But , in fact , the print date was the early 198@@ 0s , when I would have been starting prim@@ ary school and form@@ ing an understanding of myself outside the family unit and as related to the other kids and the world around me .
And , nee@@ d@@ less to say , thank God I wasn &apos;t using a thes@@ aur@@ us back then .
I mean , from this en@@ try , it would seem that I was born into a world that perce@@ ived someone like me to have nothing positive what@@ so@@ ever going for them , when in fact , today I &apos;m celebr@@ ated for the opportunities and ad@@ ven@@ tures my life has pro@@ cu@@ red .
So , I immediately went to look up the 2009 online e@@ dition , exp@@ ecting to find a re@@ vision worth not@@ ing .
Here &apos;s the up@@ d@@ ated version of this en@@ try .
Un@@ fortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
I find the last two words under &quot; N@@ ear An@@ ton@@ y@@ ms , &quot; particularly un@@ sett@@ ling : &quot; whole &quot; and &quot; wh@@ ol@@ esome . &quot;
So , it &apos;s not just about the words .
It &apos;s what we believe about people when we name them with these words .
It &apos;s about the values behind the words , and how we construc@@ t those values .
Our language aff@@ ects our thinking and how we view the world and how we view other people .
In fact , many ancient societies , including the Gre@@ e@@ ks and the Rom@@ ans , believed that to ut@@ ter a cur@@ se verb@@ ally was so powerful , because to say the thing out l@@ oud brought it into existence .
So , what reality do we want to call into existence : a person who is limited , or a person who &apos;s em@@ powered ?
By ca@@ su@@ ally doing something as simple as nam@@ ing a person , a child , we might be putting li@@ ds and cas@@ ting sh@@ ado@@ ws on their power .
W@@ ouldn &apos;t we want to open do@@ ors for them instead ?
One such person who opened do@@ ors for me was my childhood doctor at the A@@ .@@ I@@ . du@@ P@@ ont Institute in Wil@@ min@@ g@@ ton , Del@@ aware .
His name was Dr. P@@ iz@@ z@@ util@@ lo , an Ital@@ ian American , whose name , appar@@ ently , was too difficult for most Americans to pron@@ oun@@ ce , so he went by Dr. P .
And Dr. P always w@@ ore really color@@ ful b@@ ow ties and had the very perfect dis@@ position to work with children .
I loved almost everything about my time spent at this hospital , with the exception of my physical therapy s@@ essions .
I had to do what seemed like in@@ nu@@ mer@@ able re@@ peti@@ tions of exer@@ cis@@ es with these th@@ ick , el@@ as@@ tic ban@@ ds -- different colors , you know -- to help build up my leg muscles , and I h@@ ated these ban@@ ds more than anything -- I h@@ ated them , had names for them . I h@@ ated them .
And , you know , I was already b@@ arg@@ aining , as a five year-old child , with Dr. P to try to get out of doing these exer@@ cis@@ es , un@@ success@@ fully , of course .
And , one day , he came in to my s@@ ession -- ex@@ h@@ aus@@ tive and un@@ for@@ giving , these s@@ essions -- and he said to me , &quot; Wow . A@@ im@@ ee , you are such a strong and powerful little girl , I think you &apos;re going to break one of those ban@@ ds .
When you do break it , I &apos;m going to give you a hundred bu@@ cks . &quot;
Now , of course , this was a simple pl@@ o@@ y on Dr. P &apos;s part to get me to do the exer@@ cis@@ es I didn &apos;t want to do before the prosp@@ ect of being the rich@@ est fi@@ ve@@ -year-old in the second floor ward , but what he effectively did for me was res@@ h@@ ape an awful daily oc@@ curr@@ ence into a new and prom@@ is@@ ing experience for me .
And I have to wonder today to what ex@@ tent his vision and his dec@@ lar@@ ation of me as a strong and powerful little girl shap@@ ed my own view of myself as an inher@@ ently strong , powerful and ath@@ le@@ tic person well into the future .
This is an example of how adults in positions of power can ign@@ ite the power of a child .
But , in the previ@@ ous inst@@ ances of those thes@@ aur@@ us en@@ tries , our language isn &apos;t allo@@ wing us to evol@@ ve into the reality that we would all want , the possibility of an individual to see themselves as capable .
Our language hasn &apos;t caught up with the changes in our society , many of which have been brought about by technology .
Cert@@ ain@@ ly , from a medical stand@@ point , my legs , laser surgery for vision imp@@ air@@ ment , tit@@ ani@@ um k@@ ne@@ es and hi@@ p re@@ plac@@ ements for aging bodies that are allo@@ wing people to more fully engage with their abilities , and move beyond the lim@@ its that nature has im@@ posed on them -- not to mention social net@@ working plat@@ forms allow people to self-@@ identify , to claim their own descri@@ p@@ tions of themselves , so they can go al@@ ign with global groups of their own cho@@ os@@ ing .
So , perhaps technology is reve@@ aling more clearly to us now what has always been a truth : that everyone has something rare and powerful to offer our society , and that the human ability to adap@@ t is our greatest ass@@ et .
The human ability to adap@@ t , it &apos;s an interesting thing , because people have continu@@ ally wanted to talk to me about over@@ coming ad@@ versity , and I &apos;m going to make an ad@@ mission : This phrase never sat right with me , and I always felt un@@ easy trying to answer people &apos;s questions about it , and I think I &apos;m starting to figure out why .
I@@ mp@@ lic@@ it in this phrase of &quot; over@@ coming ad@@ versity &quot; is the idea that success , or happiness , is about emerging on the other side of a challeng@@ ing experience un@@ sc@@ ath@@ ed or un@@ mar@@ ked by the experience , as if my succ@@ esses in life have come about from an ability to si@@ des@@ te@@ p or circum@@ navig@@ ate the pres@@ um@@ ed pit@@ fall@@ s of a life with pro@@ s@@ the@@ tics , or what other people perce@@ ive as my dis@@ ability .
But , in fact , we are changed . We are mar@@ ked , of course , by a challenge , whether physi@@ cally , emo@@ tion@@ ally or both .
And I &apos;m going to suggest that this is a good thing .
Ad@@ versity isn &apos;t an obstac@@ le that we need to get around in order to res@@ u@@ me living our life .
It &apos;s part of our life .
And I tend to think of it like my sh@@ ado@@ w .
Sometimes I see a lot of it , sometimes there &apos;s very little , but it &apos;s always with me .
And , certainly , I &apos;m not trying to dimin@@ ish the impact , the weight , of a person &apos;s struggle .
There is ad@@ versity and challenge in life , and it &apos;s all very real and relative to every single person , but the question isn &apos;t whether or not you &apos;re going to meet ad@@ versity , but how you &apos;re going to meet it .
So , our responsibility is not simply shi@@ el@@ ding those we care for from ad@@ versity , but prepar@@ ing them to meet it well .
And we do a dis@@ service to our kids when we make them feel that they &apos;re not equi@@ pped to adap@@ t .
There &apos;s an important difference and distinc@@ tion between the objec@@ tive medical fact of my being an am@@ pu@@ te@@ e and the subj@@ ective soci@@ et@@ al opinion of whether or not I &apos;m dis@@ ab@@ led .
And , tru@@ th@@ fully , the only real and consist@@ ent dis@@ ability I &apos;ve had to con@@ front is the world ever thinking that I could be described by those defin@@ i@@ tions .
In our desire to protect those we care about by giving them the cold , hard truth about their medical pro@@ g@@ no@@ sis , or , indeed , a pro@@ g@@ no@@ sis on the expected quality of their life , we have to make sure that we don &apos;t put the first bri@@ ck in a wall that will actually dis@@ able someone .
Per@@ haps the existing model of only looking at what is broken in you and how do we fix it , ser@@ ves to be more dis@@ ab@@ ling to the individual than the path@@ ology itself .
By not tre@@ ating the wh@@ ol@@ eness of a person , by not ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ging their po@@ ten@@ cy , we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural struggle they might have .
We are effectively grad@@ ing someone &apos;s worth to our community .
So we need to see through the path@@ ology and into the range of human cap@@ ability .
And , most importantly , there &apos;s a part@@ ner@@ ship between those perce@@ ived de@@ fici@@ encies and our greatest creative ability .
So it &apos;s not about dev@@ alu@@ ing , or neg@@ ating , these more trying times as something we want to avoid or swe@@ ep under the ru@@ g , but instead to find those opportunities wr@@ apped in the ad@@ versity .
So maybe the idea I want to put out there is not so much over@@ coming ad@@ versity as it is opening ourselves up to it , embr@@ ac@@ ing it , grap@@ pl@@ ing with it , to use a w@@ rest@@ ling term , maybe even d@@ ancing with it .
And , perhaps , if we see ad@@ versity as natural , consist@@ ent and useful , we &apos;re less bur@@ den@@ ed by the pres@@ ence of it .
This year we celebr@@ ate the 200@@ th bir@@ th@@ day of Charles Darwin , and it was 150 years ago , when writing about evolution , that Darwin illustr@@ ated , I think , a truth about the human character .
To par@@ aph@@ rase : It &apos;s not the strong@@ est of the species that survi@@ ves , nor is it the most intelligent that survi@@ ves ; it is the one that is most adap@@ table to change .
Con@@ f@@ lic@@ t is the gen@@ es@@ is of creation .
From Darwin &apos;s work , am@@ ong@@ st others , we can recognize that the human ability to survive and fl@@ our@@ ish is driven by the struggle of the human spirit through conflict into transformation .
So , again , transformation , adap@@ tation , is our greatest human sk@@ ill .
And , perhaps , until we &apos;re tes@@ ted , we don &apos;t know what we &apos;re made of .
Maybe that &apos;s what ad@@ versity gives us : a sense of self , a sense of our own power .
So , we can give ourselves a gi@@ ft .
We can re-@@ imagine ad@@ versity as something more than just tough times .
Maybe we can see it as change .
Ad@@ versity is just change that we haven &apos;t adap@@ ted ourselves to yet .
I think the greatest ad@@ versity that we &apos;ve created for ourselves is this idea of nor@@ mal@@ cy .
Now , who &apos;s normal ?
There &apos;s no normal .
There &apos;s common , there &apos;s typical . There &apos;s no normal , and would you want to meet that poor , be@@ ig@@ e person if they exis@@ ted ?
I don &apos;t think so .
If we can change this paradig@@ m from one of achiev@@ ing nor@@ mal@@ cy to one of possibility -- or po@@ ten@@ cy , to be even a little bit more dangerous -- we can release the power of so many more children , and invite them to engage their rare and valuable abilities with the community .
An@@ thro@@ po@@ logists tell us that the one thing we as humans have always required of our community members is to be of use , to be able to contribu@@ te .
There &apos;s evidence that Ne@@ ander@@ th@@ als , 6@@ 0,000 years ago , car@@ ried their el@@ der@@ ly and those with serious physical inj@@ ury , and perhaps it &apos;s because the life experience of survival of these people pro@@ ved of value to the community .
They didn &apos;t view these people as broken and us@@ eless ; they were seen as rare and valuable .
A few years ago , I was in a food market in the town where I grew up in that red zone in nor@@ the@@ as@@ tern P@@ enn@@ sy@@ l@@ van@@ ia , and I was standing over a bus@@ h@@ el of tom@@ ato@@ es .
It was sum@@ mer@@ time : I had shor@@ ts on .
I hear this guy , his voice behind me say , &quot; Well , if it isn &apos;t A@@ im@@ ee M@@ ul@@ l@@ ins . &quot;
And I turn around , and it &apos;s this older man . I have no idea who he is .
And I said , &quot; I &apos;m sorry , sir , have we met ? I don &apos;t remember meeting you . &quot;
He said , &quot; Well , you wouldn &apos;t remember meeting me .
I mean , when we met I was deli@@ vering you from your mother &apos;s wom@@ b . &quot;
Oh , that guy .
And , but of course , actually , it did click .
This man was Dr. Ke@@ an , a man that I had only known about through my mother &apos;s stories of that day , because , of course , typical fashion , I arrived late for my bir@@ th@@ day by two weeks .
And so my mother &apos;s pren@@ at@@ al physici@@ an had gone on vac@@ ation , so the man who deli@@ vered me was a complete str@@ anger to my parents .
And , because I was born without the fi@@ bu@@ la b@@ ones , and had feet turned in , and a few to@@ es in this foot and a few to@@ es in that , he had to be the be@@ ar@@ er -- this str@@ anger had to be the be@@ ar@@ er of bad news .
He said to me , &quot; I had to give this pro@@ g@@ no@@ sis to your parents that you would never walk , and you would never have the kind of mo@@ bility that other kids have or any kind of life of in@@ depend@@ ence , and you &apos;ve been making li@@ ar out of me ever since . &quot;
The extraordinary thing is that he said he had saved newsp@@ aper cli@@ pp@@ ings throughout my whole childhood , whether win@@ ning a second grade sp@@ elling be@@ e , mar@@ ching with the G@@ ir@@ l S@@ cou@@ ts , you know , the H@@ allo@@ ween par@@ ade , win@@ ning my college sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ ship , or any of my sports vic@@ t@@ ories , and he was using it , and integr@@ ating it into teaching res@@ ident students , med students from H@@ ah@@ n@@ em@@ an@@ n Medic@@ al School and Her@@ sh@@ ey Medic@@ al School .
And he called this part of the course the X F@@ actor , the potential of the human will .
No pro@@ g@@ no@@ sis can account for how powerful this could be as a determin@@ ant in the quality of someone &apos;s life .
And Dr. Ke@@ an went on to tell me , he said , &quot; In my experience , unless repe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly told otherwise , and even if given a modi@@ cu@@ m of support , if left to their own devices , a child will achieve . &quot;
See , Dr. Ke@@ an made that shift in thinking .
He understood that there &apos;s a difference between the medical condition and what someone might do with it .
And there &apos;s been a shift in my thinking over time , in that , if you had asked me at 15 years old , if I would have tr@@ aded pro@@ s@@ the@@ tics for fl@@ es@@ h@@ -@@ and-@@ bone legs , I wouldn &apos;t have h@@ es@@ it@@ ated for a second .
I as@@ pi@@ red to that kind of nor@@ mal@@ cy back then .
But if you ask me today , I &apos;m not so sure .
And it &apos;s because of the experiences I &apos;ve had with them , not in sp@@ ite of the experiences I &apos;ve had with them .
And perhaps this shift in me has happened because I &apos;ve been ex@@ posed to more people who have opened do@@ ors for me than those who have put li@@ ds and c@@ ast sh@@ ado@@ ws on me .
See , all you really need is one person to show you the epi@@ ph@@ any of your own power , and you &apos;re off .
If you can hand somebody the key to their own power -- the human spirit is so re@@ cep@@ tive -- if you can do that and open a door for someone at a crucial moment , you are educ@@ ating them in the best sense .
You &apos;re teaching them to open do@@ ors for themselves .
In fact , the exact meaning of the word &quot; educ@@ ate &quot; comes from the ro@@ ot word &quot; e@@ duce . &quot;
It means &quot; to bring forth what is within , to bring out potential . &quot;
So again , which potential do we want to bring out ?
There was a case study done in 196@@ 0s Britain , when they were moving from gram@@ ma@@ r schools to com@@ pre@@ hen@@ sive schools .
It &apos;s called the stre@@ aming trials . We call it &quot; trac@@ king &quot; here in the States .
It &apos;s separ@@ ating students from A , B , C , D and so on .
And the &quot; A students &quot; get the tou@@ gh@@ er cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um , the best teachers , etc .
Well , they took , over a three-@@ month period , D@@ -@@ level students , gave them A &apos;s , told them they were &quot; A &apos;s , &quot; told them they were bright , and at the end of this three-@@ month period , they were perform@@ ing at A@@ -@@ level .
And , of course , the hear@@ t@@ breaking , fli@@ p side of this study , is that they took the &quot; A students &quot; and told them they were &quot; D &apos;s . &quot;
And that &apos;s what happened at the end of that three-@@ month period .
Those who were still around in school , bes@@ ides the people who had dro@@ pped out .
A crucial part of this case study was that the teachers were du@@ ped too .
The teachers didn &apos;t know a switch had been made .
They were simply told , &quot; These are the &apos; A@@ -@@ students , &apos; these are the &apos; D@@ -@@ students . &apos; &quot; And that &apos;s how they went about teaching them and tre@@ ating them .
So , I think that the only true dis@@ ability is a cr@@ ush@@ ed spirit , a spirit that &apos;s been cr@@ ush@@ ed doesn &apos;t have hope , it doesn &apos;t see beauty , it no longer has our natural , child@@ like curios@@ ity and our in@@ n@@ ate ability to imagine .
If instead , we can b@@ ol@@ ster a human spirit to keep hope , to see beauty in themselves and others , to be curious and imagin@@ ative , then we are truly using our power well .
When a spirit has those quali@@ ties , we are able to create new re@@ alities and new ways of being .
I &apos;d like to leave you with a poem by a four@@ teen@@ th-@@ century Per@@ sian po@@ et named H@@ a@@ fi@@ z that my friend , J@@ ac@@ ques D@@ em@@ bo@@ is told me about , and the poem is called &quot; The God Who On@@ ly K@@ no@@ ws F@@ our Wor@@ ds &quot; : &quot; Every child has known God , not the God of names , not the God of don &apos;@@ ts , but the God who only knows four words and kee@@ ps repe@@ ating them , saying , &apos; Come dance with me .
Come , dance with me . Come , dance with me . &apos; &quot; Thank you .
You know , what I do is write for children , and I &apos;m probably America &apos;s most wid@@ ely read children &apos;s auth@@ or , in fact .
And I always tell people that I don &apos;t want to show up looking like a scientist .
You can have me as a far@@ mer , or in lea@@ thers , and no one has ever chose far@@ mer .
I &apos;m here today to talk to you about cir@@ cles and epi@@ ph@@ an@@ ies .
And you know , an epi@@ ph@@ any is usually something you find that you dro@@ pped some@@ place .
You &apos;ve just got to go around the block to see it as an epi@@ ph@@ any .
That &apos;s a painting of a circle .
A friend of mine did that -- Richard B@@ oll@@ ing@@ broke .
It &apos;s the kind of complicated circle that I &apos;m going to tell you about .
My circle began back in the &apos; 6@@ 0s in high school in S@@ to@@ w , O@@ hi@@ o where I was the class que@@ er .
I was the guy be@@ at@@ en up bloo@@ dy every week in the boys &apos; room , until one teacher saved my life .
She saved my life by l@@ etting me go to the b@@ ath@@ room in the teachers &apos; l@@ oun@@ ge .
She did it in secret .
She did it for three years .
And I had to get out of town .
I had a th@@ um@@ b , I had 85 dollars , and I ended up in San Francisco , California -- met a lo@@ ver -- and back in the &apos; 8@@ 0s , found it necessary to begin work on AIDS organizations .
A@@ bout three or four years ago , I got a phone call in the middle of the night from that teacher , M@@ r@@ s@@ . Po@@ st@@ en , who said , &quot; I need to see you .
I &apos;m dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted that we never got to know each other as adults .
Could you please come to O@@ hi@@ o , and please bring that man that I know you have found by now .
And I should mention that I have pan@@ cre@@ atic cancer , and I &apos;d like you to please be quick about this . &quot;
Well , the next day we were in C@@ lev@@ el@@ and .
We took a look at her , we laugh@@ ed , we cri@@ ed , and we knew that she needed to be in a hosp@@ ice .
We found her one , we got her there , and we took care of her and watched over her family , because it was necessary .
It &apos;s something we knew how to do .
And just as the woman who wanted to know me as an adult got to know me , she turned into a box of ash@@ es and was placed in my hands .
And what had happened was the circle had closed , it had become a circle -- and that epi@@ ph@@ any I talked about pres@@ ented itself .
The epi@@ ph@@ any is that death is a part of life .
She saved my life ; I and my partner saved h@@ ers .
And you know , that part of life needs everything that the rest of life does .
It needs truth and beauty , and I &apos;m so happy it &apos;s been mentioned so much here today .
It also needs -- it needs dign@@ ity , love and plea@@ sure , and it &apos;s our job to hand those things out .
Thank you .
As an artist , connection is very important to me .
Th@@ r@@ ough my work I &apos;m trying to arti@@ cul@@ ate that humans are not separate from nature and that everything is inter@@ connected .
I first went to Antarc@@ tic@@ a almost 10 years ago , where I saw my first ic@@ e@@ ber@@ gs .
I was in a@@ we .
My heart beat fast , my head was di@@ zz@@ y , trying to com@@ pre@@ h@@ end what it was that stood in front of me .
The ic@@ e@@ ber@@ gs around me were almost 200 feet out of the water , and I could only help but wonder that this was one s@@ now@@ fl@@ ake on top of another s@@ now@@ fl@@ ake , year after year .
I@@ ce@@ ber@@ gs are born when they cal@@ ve off of gl@@ aci@@ ers or break off of ice shel@@ ves .
Each ic@@ e@@ berg has its own individual person@@ ality .
They have a distinc@@ t way of inter@@ acting with their environment and their experiences .
Some refu@@ se to give up and hold on to the bit@@ ter end , while others can &apos;t take it anymore and cr@@ um@@ ble in a fit of dram@@ atic passion .
It &apos;s easy to think , when you look at an ic@@ e@@ berg , that they &apos;re isol@@ ated , that they &apos;re separate and alone , much like we as humans sometimes view ourselves .
But the reality is far from it .
As an ic@@ e@@ berg mel@@ ts , I am brea@@ thing in its ancient atmosphere .
As the ic@@ e@@ berg mel@@ ts , it is rele@@ as@@ ing min@@ er@@ al-@@ rich fresh water that nour@@ ish@@ es many forms of life .
I approach photograph@@ ing these ic@@ e@@ ber@@ gs as if I &apos;m making por@@ traits of my ancest@@ ors , knowing that in these individual moments they exist in that way and will never exist that way again .
It is not a death when they mel@@ t ; it is not an end , but a continu@@ ation of their path through the cycle of life .
Some of the ice in the ic@@ e@@ ber@@ gs that I photograph is very young -- a couple thousand years old .
And some of the ice is over 100,000 years old .
The last pictures I &apos;d like to show you are of an ic@@ e@@ berg that I photograph@@ ed in Q@@ e@@ q@@ et@@ ar@@ su@@ a@@ q , Green@@ land .
It &apos;s a very rare occasion that you get to actually wit@@ ness an ic@@ e@@ berg rol@@ ling .
So here it is .
You can see on the left side a small boat .
That &apos;s about a 15@@ -@@ foot boat .
And I &apos;d like you to pay attention to the shape of the ic@@ e@@ berg and where it is at the wat@@ er@@ line .
You can see here , it begins to roll , and the boat has moved to the other side , and the man is standing there .
This is an aver@@ ag@@ e-@@ size Green@@ lan@@ di@@ c ic@@ e@@ berg .
It &apos;s about 120 feet above the water , or 40 meters .
And this video is real time .
And just like that , the ic@@ e@@ berg shows you a different side of its person@@ ality .
Thank you .
I want you to imagine two cou@@ ples in the middle of 197@@ 9 on the exact same day , at the exact same moment , each con@@ ce@@ iv@@ ing a baby -- okay ?
So two cou@@ ples each con@@ ce@@ iv@@ ing one baby .
Now I don &apos;t want you to spend too much time imagin@@ ing the conception , because if you spend all that time imagin@@ ing that conception , you &apos;re not going to listen to me .
So just imagine that for a moment .
And in this scen@@ ario , I want to imagine that , in one case , the sper@@ m is carrying a Y chromo@@ some , meeting that X chromo@@ some of the eg@@ g .
And in the other case , the sper@@ m is carrying an X chromo@@ some , meeting the X chromo@@ some of the eg@@ g .
B@@ oth are vi@@ able ; both take off .
We &apos;ll come back to these people later .
So I wear two h@@ ats in most of what I do .
As the one h@@ at , I do history of an@@ atom@@ y .
I &apos;m a histori@@ an by training , and what I study in that case is the way that people have de@@ al@@ t with an@@ atom@@ y -- meaning human bodies , animal bodies -- how they de@@ al@@ t with bo@@ d@@ ily flu@@ ids , concepts of bodies ; how have they thought about bodies .
The other h@@ at that I &apos;ve wor@@ n in my work is as an activis@@ t , as a patient ad@@ voc@@ ate -- or , as I sometimes say , as an imp@@ ati@@ ent ad@@ voc@@ ate -- for people who are patients of doctors .
In that case , what I &apos;ve worked with is people who have body types that challenge social nor@@ ms .
So some of what I &apos;ve worked on , for example , is people who are con@@ jo@@ ined tw@@ ins -- two people within one body .
Some of what I &apos;ve worked on is people who have d@@ war@@ f@@ ism -- so people who are much shor@@ ter than typical .
And a lot of what I &apos;ve worked on is people who have at@@ y@@ pic@@ al sex -- so people who don &apos;t have the standard male or the standard female body types .
And as a general term , we can use the term inter@@ sex for this .
Inter@@ sex comes in a lot of different forms .
I &apos;ll just give you a few examples of the types of ways you can have sex that isn &apos;t standard for male or female .
So in one instance , you can have somebody who has an X@@ Y chromo@@ som@@ al basis , and that S@@ R@@ Y gene on the Y chromo@@ some tells the prot@@ o-@@ g@@ on@@ ads , which we all have in the f@@ et@@ al life , to become tes@@ tes .
And so in the f@@ et@@ al life the tes@@ tes are pu@@ mp@@ ing out tes@@ to@@ ster@@ one .
But because this individual l@@ acks re@@ cep@@ tors to hear that tes@@ to@@ ster@@ one , the body doesn &apos;t re@@ act to the tes@@ to@@ ster@@ one .
And this is a syn@@ drome called and@@ ro@@ gen in@@ sensi@@ tivity syn@@ drome .
So lots of levels of tes@@ to@@ ster@@ one , but no reaction to it .
As a conse@@ quence , the body develop@@ s more along the female typical path .
When the child is born , she looks like a girl .
She is a girl . She is raised as a girl .
And it &apos;s often not until she h@@ its pu@@ ber@@ ty and she &apos;s growing and developing bre@@ as@@ ts , but she &apos;s not getting her period , that somebody figures out something &apos;s up here .
And they do some tests and figure out that , instead of having o@@ v@@ aries inside and a u@@ ter@@ us , she actually has tes@@ tes inside , and she has a Y chromo@@ some .
Now what &apos;s important to understand is you may think of this person as really being male , but they &apos;re really not .
F@@ em@@ ales , like males , have in our bodies something called the ad@@ ren@@ al gl@@ ands .
They &apos;re in the back of our body .
And the ad@@ ren@@ al gl@@ ands make and@@ ro@@ gens , which are a mas@@ cul@@ in@@ izing hor@@ m@@ one .
Most fem@@ ales like me -- I believe myself to be a typical female -- I don &apos;t actually know my chromo@@ som@@ al ma@@ k@@ e-@@ up but I think I &apos;m probably typical -- most fem@@ ales like me are actually and@@ ro@@ gen@@ -@@ sensitive .
We &apos;re making and@@ ro@@ gen , and we &apos;re respon@@ ding to and@@ ro@@ gens .
The conse@@ quence is that somebody like me has actually had a brain ex@@ posed to more and@@ ro@@ gens than the woman born with tes@@ tes who has and@@ ro@@ gen in@@ sensi@@ tivity syn@@ drome .
So sex is really complicated ; it &apos;s not just that inter@@ sex people are in the middle of all the sex spectrum -- in some ways , they can be all over the place .
Another example : a few years ago I got a call from a man who was 19 years old , who was born a boy , raised a boy , had a gir@@ l@@ friend , had sex with his gir@@ l@@ friend , had a life as a guy and had just found out that he had o@@ v@@ aries and a u@@ ter@@ us inside .
What he had was an extreme form of a condition called con@@ gen@@ ital ad@@ ren@@ al hyper@@ plas@@ ia .
He had X@@ X chromo@@ som@@ es , and in the wom@@ b , his ad@@ ren@@ al gl@@ ands were in such high g@@ ear that it created , essentially , a mas@@ cul@@ ine hormon@@ al environment .
And as a conse@@ quence , his gen@@ it@@ als were mas@@ cul@@ in@@ zed , his brain was subject to the more typical mas@@ cul@@ ine compon@@ ent of hormon@@ es .
And he was born looking like a boy -- nobody su@@ spec@@ ted anything .
And it was only when he had reach@@ ed the age of 19 that he began to have enough medical problems actually from men@@ stru@@ ating intern@@ ally , that doctors figured out that , in fact , he was female intern@@ ally .
Okay , so just one more quick example of a way you can have inter@@ sex .
Some people who have X@@ X chromo@@ som@@ es develop what are called o@@ vot@@ esti@@ s , which is when you have o@@ vari@@ an tissue with t@@ esti@@ cul@@ ar tissue wr@@ apped around it .
And we &apos;re not exactly sure why that happens .
So sex can come in lots of different vari@@ eties .
The reason that children with these kinds of bodies -- whether it &apos;s d@@ war@@ f@@ ism , or it &apos;s con@@ jo@@ ined tw@@ inning , or it &apos;s an inter@@ sex type -- are often nor@@ mal@@ ized by surge@@ ons is not because it actually leaves them better off in terms of physical health .
In many cases , people are actually perfectly healthy .
The reason they &apos;re often subject to various kinds of sur@@ ger@@ ies is because they threat@@ en our social categ@@ ories .
Or system has been based typic@@ ally on the idea that a particular kind of an@@ atom@@ y comes with a particular identity .
So we have the concept that what it means to be a woman is to have a female identity ; what it means to be a black person is , alle@@ ge@@ dly , is to have an African an@@ atom@@ y in terms of your history .
And so we have this terri@@ bly simpl@@ istic idea .
And when we &apos;re fac@@ ed with a body that actually pres@@ ents us something quite different , it star@@ t@@ les us in terms of those categ@@ or@@ iz@@ ations .
So we have a lot of very roman@@ tic ideas in our culture about individu@@ alism .
And our nation &apos;s really f@@ ounded on a very roman@@ tic concept of individu@@ alism .
Well you can imagine how star@@ t@@ ling then it is when you have children that are born who are two people inside of one body .
Where I ran into the most heat from this most recently was last year the South African run@@ ner , C@@ aster S@@ em@@ en@@ ya , had her sex called into question at the International G@@ ames in Ber@@ lin .
I had a lot of journalis@@ ts calling me , asking me , &quot; Which is the test they &apos;re going to run that will tell us whether or not C@@ aster S@@ em@@ en@@ ya is male or female ? &quot;
And I had to explain to the journalis@@ ts there isn &apos;t such a test .
In fact , we now know that sex is complicated enough that we have to ad@@ mit nature doesn &apos;t draw the line for us between male and female , or between male and inter@@ sex and female and inter@@ sex ; we actually draw that line on nature .
So what we have is a sort of situation where the far@@ ther our science goes , the more we have to ad@@ mit to ourselves that these categ@@ ories that we thought of as stable an@@ atom@@ ical categ@@ ories that m@@ apped very simply to stable identity categ@@ ories are a lot more fu@@ zz@@ y than we thought .
And it &apos;s not just in terms of sex .
It &apos;s also in terms of race , which turns out to be vas@@ tly more complicated than our termin@@ ology has allowed .
As we look , we get into all sorts of un@@ comfortable areas .
We look , for example , about the fact that we share at least 95 percent of our DNA with chimpanz@@ ees .
What are we to make of the fact that we diff@@ er from them only really by a few nu@@ cle@@ o@@ ti@@ des ?
And as we get far@@ ther and far@@ ther with our science , we get more and more into a dis@@ com@@ for@@ ted zone where we have to ac@@ knowledge that the simpl@@ istic categ@@ ories we &apos;ve had are probably over@@ ly simpl@@ istic .
So we &apos;re seeing this in all sorts of places in human life .
One of the places we &apos;re seeing it , for example , in our culture today , in the United States today , is batt@@ les over the beginning of life and the end of life .
We have difficult conversations about at what point we decide a body becomes a human , such that it has a different right than a f@@ et@@ al life .
We have very difficult conversations now@@ ad@@ ays -- probably not out in the open as much as within medicine -- about the question of when somebody &apos;s dead .
In the past , our ancest@@ ors never had to struggle so much with this question of when somebody was dead .
At most , they &apos;d stick a f@@ ea@@ ther on somebody &apos;s no@@ se , and if it t@@ wit@@ ched , they didn &apos;t bu@@ ry them yet .
If it stopped t@@ wit@@ ching , you bu@@ ry them .
But today , we have a situation where we want to take v@@ ital org@@ ans out of beings and give them to other beings .
And as a conse@@ quence , we &apos;re stuck with having to struggle with this really difficult question about who &apos;s dead , and this leads us to a really difficult situation where we don &apos;t have such simple categ@@ ories as we &apos;ve had before .
Now you might think that all this break@@ ing-@@ down of categ@@ ories would make somebody like me really happy .
I &apos;m a political progr@@ essive , I def@@ end people with unusual bodies , but I have to ad@@ mit to you that it makes me nervous .
Un@@ der@@ standing that these categ@@ ories are really much more un@@ stable than we thought makes me ten@@ se .
And it makes me ten@@ se from the point of view of thinking about democracy .
So in order to tell you about that tension , I have to first ad@@ mit to you that I &apos;m a huge fan of the F@@ oun@@ ding F@@ ath@@ ers .
I know they were rac@@ ists , I know they were sex@@ ist , but they were great .
I mean , they were so br@@ ave and so b@@ old and so radical in what they did that I find myself watching that che@@ es@@ y musical &quot; 17@@ 7@@ 6 &quot; every few years , and it &apos;s not because of the music , which is totally for@@ get@@ table .
It &apos;s because of what happened in 17@@ 7@@ 6 with the F@@ oun@@ ding F@@ ath@@ ers .
The F@@ oun@@ ding F@@ ath@@ ers were , for my point of view , the original an@@ atom@@ ical activis@@ ts , and this is why .
What they rej@@ ected was an an@@ atom@@ ical concept and re@@ placed it with another one that was radical and beautiful and held us for 200 years .
So as you all rec@@ all , what our F@@ oun@@ ding F@@ ath@@ ers were rej@@ ecting was a concept of mon@@ arch@@ y , and the mon@@ arch@@ y was basically based on a very simpl@@ istic concept of an@@ atom@@ y .
The mon@@ arch@@ s of the old world didn &apos;t have a concept of DNA , but they did have a concept of bir@@ th@@ right .
They had a concept of blue blood .
They had the idea that the people who would be in political power should be in political power because of the blood being passed down from grand@@ father to father to son and so forth .
The F@@ oun@@ ding F@@ ath@@ ers rej@@ ected that idea , and they re@@ placed it with a new an@@ atom@@ ical concept , and that concept was all men are created equal .
They lev@@ eled that playing field and decided the an@@ atom@@ y that mat@@ tered was the com@@ mon@@ ality of an@@ atom@@ y , not the difference in an@@ atom@@ y , and that was a really radical thing to do .
Now they were doing it in part because they were part of an En@@ li@@ ghten@@ ment system where two things were growing up together .
And that was democracy growing up , but it was also science growing up at the same time .
And it &apos;s really clear , if you look at the history of the F@@ oun@@ ding F@@ ath@@ ers , a lot of them were very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a natur@@ alis@@ tic world .
They were moving away from super@@ natural explan@@ ations , and they were rej@@ ecting things like a super@@ natural concept of power , where it trans@@ mit@@ ted because of a very vague concept of bir@@ th@@ right .
They were moving towards a natur@@ alis@@ tic concept .
And if you look , for example , in the D@@ ec@@ lar@@ ation of In@@ depend@@ ence , they talk about nature and nature &apos;s God .
They don &apos;t talk about God and God &apos;s nature .
They &apos;re talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
So as part of that , they were coming to us with a concept that was about an@@ atom@@ ical com@@ mon@@ ality .
And in doing so , they were really setting up in a beautiful way the Ci@@ vi@@ l Ri@@ ghts movement of the future .
They didn &apos;t think of it that way , but they did it for us , and it was great .
So what happened years after@@ ward ?
What happened was women , for example , who wanted the right to vote , took the F@@ oun@@ ding F@@ ath@@ ers &apos; concept of an@@ atom@@ ical com@@ mon@@ ality being more important than an@@ atom@@ ical difference and said , &quot; The fact that we have a u@@ ter@@ us and o@@ v@@ aries is not significant enough in terms of a difference to mean that we shouldn &apos;t have the right to vote , the right to full citiz@@ en@@ ship , the right to own property , etc . , etc . &quot;
And women success@@ fully argu@@ ed that .
N@@ ext came the successful Ci@@ vi@@ l Ri@@ ghts movement , where we found people like So@@ jour@@ ner Tr@@ u@@ th talking about , &quot; A@@ in &apos;t I a woman ? &quot;
We find men on the mar@@ ching lines of the Ci@@ vi@@ l Ri@@ ghts movement saying , &quot; I am a man . &quot;
Again , people of color appe@@ aling to a com@@ mon@@ ality of an@@ atom@@ y over a difference of an@@ atom@@ y , again , success@@ fully .
We see the same thing with the dis@@ ability rights movement .
The problem is , of course , that , as we begin to look at all that com@@ mon@@ ality , we have to begin to question why we ma@@ intain certain divis@@ ions .
Now mind you , I want to ma@@ intain some divis@@ ions , an@@ atom@@ ically , in our culture .
For example , I don &apos;t want to give a fish the same rights as a human .
I don &apos;t want to say we give up entirely on an@@ atom@@ y .
I don &apos;t want to say fi@@ ve-@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds should be allowed to con@@ sent to sex or con@@ sent to mar@@ ry .
So there are some an@@ atom@@ ical divis@@ ions that make sense to me and that I think we should ret@@ ain .
But the challenge is trying to figure out which ones they are and why do we ret@@ ain them and do they have meaning .
So let &apos;s go back to those two beings con@@ ce@@ ived at the beginning of this talk .
We have two beings , both con@@ ce@@ ived in the middle of 197@@ 9 on the exact same day .
Let &apos;s imagine one of them , Mary , is born three months pre@@ m@@ atu@@ rely , so she &apos;s born on J@@ une 1 , 1980 .
Hen@@ ry , by contr@@ ast , is born at term , so he &apos;s born on Mar@@ ch 1 , 1980 .
Sim@@ ply by virtu@@ e of the fact that Mary was born pre@@ m@@ atu@@ rely three months , she comes into all sorts of rights three months earlier than Hen@@ ry does -- the right to con@@ sent to sex , the right to vote , the right to drink .
Hen@@ ry has to wait for all of that , not because he &apos;s actually any different in age , biolog@@ ically , except in terms of when he was born .
We find other kinds of we@@ ir@@ d@@ ness in terms of what their rights are .
Hen@@ ry , by virtu@@ e of being as@@ sum@@ ed to be male -- although I haven &apos;t told you that he &apos;s the X@@ Y one -- by virtu@@ e of being as@@ sum@@ ed to be male is now li@@ able to be dr@@ af@@ ted , which Mary does not need to worry about .
Mary , mean@@ while , cannot in all the states have the same right that Hen@@ ry has in all the states , nam@@ ely , the right to mar@@ ry .
Hen@@ ry can mar@@ ry in every state a woman , but Mary can only mar@@ ry today in a few states a woman .
So we have these an@@ atom@@ ical categ@@ ories that pers@@ ist that are in many ways probl@@ em@@ atic and ques@@ tion@@ able .
And the question to me becomes : What do we do , as our science gets to be so good in looking at an@@ atom@@ y , that we reach the point where we have to ad@@ mit that a democracy that &apos;s been based on an@@ atom@@ y might start fall@@ ing apart ?
I don &apos;t want to give up the science , but at the same time it kind of feels sometimes like the science is coming out from under us .
So where do we go ?
It seems like what happens in our culture is a sort of pr@@ ag@@ mati@@ c attitude : &quot; Well , we have to draw the line somewhere , so we will draw the line somewhere . &quot;
But a lot of people get stuck in a very strange position .
So for example , Texas has at one point decided that what it means to mar@@ ry a man is to mean that you don &apos;t have a Y chromo@@ some , and what it means to mar@@ ry a woman means you do have a Y chromo@@ some .
Now in practice they don &apos;t actually test people for their chromo@@ som@@ es .
But this is also very bizarre , because of the story I told you at the beginning about and@@ ro@@ gen in@@ sensi@@ tivity syn@@ drome .
If we look at one of the f@@ oun@@ ding fa@@ thers of modern democracy , Dr. Martin Lu@@ ther King , he off@@ ers us something of a solution in his &quot; I have a dream &quot; speech .
He says we should ju@@ dge people &quot; based not on the color of their skin , but on the content of their character , &quot; moving beyond an@@ atom@@ y .
And I want to say , &quot; Yeah , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
But in practice , how do you do it ?
How do you ju@@ dge people based on the content of character ?
I also want to point out that I &apos;m not sure that is how we should distribu@@ te rights in terms of humans , because , I have to ad@@ mit , that there are some gol@@ den re@@ tri@@ ev@@ ers I know that are probably more des@@ er@@ ving of social services than some humans I know .
I also want to say there are probably also some yellow L@@ ab@@ r@@ ad@@ ors that I know that are more capable of inform@@ ed , intelligent , m@@ ature decisions about sexual relations than some 4@@ 0-@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds that I know .
So how do we oper@@ ation@@ alize the question of content of character ?
It turns out to be really difficult .
And part of me also won@@ ders , what if content of character turns out to be something that &apos;s scann@@ able in the future -- able to be seen with an f@@ M@@ R@@ I ?
Do we really want to go there ?
I &apos;m not sure where we go .
What I do know is that it seems to be really important to think about the idea of the United States being in the lead of thinking about this issue of democracy .
We &apos;ve done a really good job stru@@ ggl@@ ing with democracy , and I think we would do a good job in the future .
We don &apos;t have a situation that Iran has , for example , where a man who &apos;s sexu@@ ally attr@@ acted to other men is li@@ able to be mur@@ der@@ ed , unless he &apos;s willing to sub@@ mit to a sex change , in which case he &apos;s allowed to live .
We don &apos;t have that kind of situation .
I &apos;m gl@@ ad to say we don &apos;t have the kind of situation with -- a surge@@ on I talked to a few years ago who had brought over a set of con@@ jo@@ ined tw@@ ins in order to separate them , part@@ ly to make a name for himself .
But when I was on the phone with him , asking why he was going to do this surgery -- this was a very high-@@ risk surgery -- his answer was that , in this other nation , these children were going to be treated very bad@@ ly , and so he had to do this .
My response to him was , &quot; Well , have you considered political as@@ y@@ lu@@ m instead of a separ@@ ation surgery ? &quot;
The United States has off@@ ered tremendous possibility for allo@@ wing people to be the way they are , without having them have to be changed for the sa@@ ke of the state .
So I think we have to be in the lead .
Well , just to close , I want to suggest to you that I &apos;ve been talking a lot about the fa@@ thers .
And I want to think about the possibilities of what democracy might look like , or might have looked like , if we had more involved the mothers .
And I want to say something a little bit radical for a fem@@ in@@ ist , and that is that I think that there may be different kinds of insi@@ ghts that can come from different kinds of an@@ atom@@ ies , particularly when we have people thinking in groups .
Now for years , because I &apos;ve been interested in inter@@ sex , I &apos;ve also been interested in sex difference research .
And one of the things that I &apos;ve been really interested in is looking at the differences between males and fem@@ ales in terms of the way they think and operate in the world .
And what we know from cross@@ -@@ cultural studies is that fem@@ ales , on average -- not everyone , but on average -- are more in@@ clin@@ ed to be very atten@@ tive to complex social relations and to taking care of people who are basically vulnerable within the group .
And so if we think about that , we have an interesting situation on our hands .
Y@@ ears ago , when I was in graduate school , one of my graduate ad@@ vis@@ ers who knew I was interested in fem@@ in@@ ism -- I considered myself a fem@@ in@@ ist , as I still do -- asked a really strange question .
He said , &quot; T@@ ell me what &apos;s fem@@ in@@ ine about fem@@ in@@ ism . &quot;
And I thought , &quot; Well that &apos;s the du@@ m@@ best question I &apos;ve ever heard .
F@@ em@@ in@@ ism is all about un@@ doing st@@ ere@@ oty@@ pes about gender , so there &apos;s nothing fem@@ in@@ ine about fem@@ in@@ ism . &quot;
But the more I thought about his question , the more I thought there might be something fem@@ in@@ ine about fem@@ in@@ ism .
That is to say , there might be something , on average , different about female brains from male brains that makes us more atten@@ tive to deeply complex social relationships and more atten@@ tive to taking care of the vulnerable .
So wh@@ ereas the fa@@ thers were extremely atten@@ tive to figu@@ ring out how to protect individuals from the state , it &apos;s possible that if we inj@@ ected more mothers into this concept , what we would have is more of a concept of , not just how to protect , but how to care for each other .
And maybe that &apos;s where we need to go in the future , when we take democracy beyond an@@ atom@@ y , is to think less about the individual body , in terms of the identity , and think more about those relationships .
So that as we the people try to create a more perfect uni@@ on , we &apos;re thinking about what we do for each other .
Thank you .
In 2007 , I decided that we needed to re@@ concep@@ tu@@ alize how we thought about economic development .
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks about where they want to live and work , they should be able to choose between at least a hand@@ ful of different cities that were all comp@@ eting to attr@@ act new res@@ id@@ ents .
Now we &apos;re a long way away from that goal right now .
There are billions of people in developing countries who don &apos;t have even a single city that would be willing to wel@@ come them .
But the amazing thing about cities is they &apos;re worth so much more than it costs to build them .
So we could easily supply the world with do@@ z@@ ens , maybe hundreds , of new cities .
Now this might sound pre@@ pos@@ ter@@ ous to you if you &apos;ve never thought about new cities .
But just sub@@ stitu@@ te ap@@ art@@ ment building for cities .
Imagine half the people who wanted to be in ap@@ art@@ ments already had them ; the other half aren &apos;t there yet .
You could try and exp@@ and the capacity by doing addi@@ tions on all the existing ap@@ art@@ ments .
But you know what you &apos;d run into is those ap@@ art@@ ments and the surr@@ oun@@ ding areas have rules to avoid dis@@ com@@ fort and the distr@@ actions of construction .
So it &apos;s extremely hard to do all of those addi@@ tions .
But you could go out some@@ place brand new , build a brand new ap@@ art@@ ment building , as long as the rules there were ones that facil@@ it@@ ated construction rather than getting in the way .
So I pro@@ posed that governments create new re@@ form zones big enough to hold cities and gave them a name : char@@ ter cities .
L@@ ater I learned that at about this same time , J@@ av@@ ier and Oc@@ t@@ avi@@ o were thinking about the challenge of re@@ form in H@@ on@@ dur@@ as .
They knew that about 7@@ 5,000 H@@ on@@ dur@@ ans every year would leave to go to the United States , and they wanted to ask , what could they do to make sure that those people could stay and do the same things in H@@ on@@ dur@@ as .
At one point , J@@ av@@ ier said to Oc@@ t@@ avi@@ o , &quot; What if we took some of our empty land -- what if we just gave it to an emb@@ ass@@ y -- give some to the U.S. emb@@ ass@@ y ; give some to the Can@@ adi@@ an emb@@ ass@@ y -- and then if people want to go work under the rules of Canada or under the rules of the United States , they can go get jobs , do everything they do on those emb@@ ass@@ y gr@@ ounds
that they would otherwise have to go to Canada or the U.S. to do ? &quot;
In the summer of 2009 , H@@ on@@ dur@@ as went through a w@@ ren@@ ching constitu@@ tional crisis .
At the next regul@@ arly sch@@ ed@@ ul@@ ed el@@ ection , Pe@@ pe L@@ ob@@ o won in a land@@ slide on a platform that prom@@ is@@ ed re@@ form , but re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation as well .
He asked Oc@@ t@@ avi@@ o to be his chi@@ ef of staf@@ f .
Me@@ an@@ while , I was getting ready to give a talk at TED@@ Global .
Th@@ r@@ ough a process of re@@ fin@@ ement , trial and er@@ ror , a lot of user testing , I tried to bo@@ il this complicated concept of char@@ ter city down to the b@@ are essenti@@ als .
The first point was the importance of rules , like those rules that say you can &apos;t come in and dis@@ tur@@ b all the existing ap@@ art@@ ment hol@@ ders .
We pay a lot of attention to new technologies , but it takes technologies and rules to get progress , and it &apos;s usually the rules that hold us back .
In the fall of 2010 , a friend from Gu@@ at@@ em@@ ala sent Oc@@ t@@ avi@@ o a link to the TED@@ Talk .
He showed it to J@@ av@@ ier .
They called me .
They said , &quot; Let &apos;s present this to the leaders of our country . &quot;
So in D@@ ec@@ ember we met in Mi@@ ami , in a hot@@ el conference room .
I tried to explain this point about how valuable cities are , how much more valuable they are than they cost .
And I used this slide showing how valuable the ra@@ w land is in a place like New York City : notice , land that &apos;s worth thousands of dollars , in some cases , per square meter .
But it was a fairly abstr@@ act discussion , and at some point when there was a pause , Oc@@ t@@ avi@@ o said , &quot; Paul , maybe we could watch the TED@@ Talk . &quot;
So the TED@@ Talk l@@ aid out in very simple terms , a char@@ ter city is a place where you start with un@@ in@@ hab@@ ited land , a char@@ ter that speci@@ fi@@ es the rules that will apply there and then a chance for people to op@@ t in , to go live under those rules or not .
So I was asked by the president of H@@ on@@ dur@@ as who said that we need to do this project , this is important , this could be the way forward for our country .
I was asked to come to T@@ e@@ gu@@ ci@@ gal@@ p@@ a and talk again on Jan@@ u@@ ary fourth and fi@@ f@@ th .
So I pres@@ ented another fac@@ t-@@ filled lecture that inclu@@ ded a slide like this , which tried to make the point that , if you want to create a lot of value in a city , it has to be very big .
This is a picture of Den@@ ver , and the out@@ line is the new air@@ port that was built in Den@@ ver .
This air@@ port alone co@@ vers more than 100 square kilometers .
So I was trying to persu@@ ade the H@@ on@@ dur@@ ans , if you build a new city , you &apos;ve got to start with a site that &apos;s at least 1,000 square kilometers .
That &apos;s more than 250 hundre@@ d-@@ thousand ac@@ res .
Everybody appl@@ au@@ ded po@@ lit@@ ely .
The faces in the audience were very serious and atten@@ tive .
The leader of the con@@ gr@@ ess came up on stage and said , &quot; Pro@@ f@@ essor Rom@@ er , thank you very much for your lecture , but maybe we could watch the TED@@ Talk .
I &apos;ve got it here on my lap@@ top . &quot;
So I sat down , and they played the TED@@ Talk .
And it got to the essence , which is that a new city could offer new choices for people .
There would be a choice of a city which you could go to which could be in H@@ on@@ dur@@ as , instead of hundreds of miles away in the North .
And it also involved new choices for leaders .
Because the leaders in the government there in H@@ on@@ dur@@ as would need help from partner countries , who could benefit from partner countries who help them set up the rules in this char@@ ter and the en@@ forc@@ ement , so everybody can trust that the char@@ ter really will be en@@ forced .
And the insi@@ ght of President L@@ ob@@ o was that that assur@@ ance of en@@ forc@@ ement that I was thinking about as a way to get the foreign invest@@ ors to come in and build the city could be equ@@ ally important for all the different parties in H@@ on@@ dur@@ as who had suff@@ ered for so many years from fear and dis@@ trust .
We went and looked at a site .
This picture &apos;s from there .
It easily could hold a thousand square kilometers .
And shor@@ tly ther@@ ea@@ f@@ ter , on Jan@@ u@@ ary 19@@ th , they vot@@ ed in the con@@ gr@@ ess to am@@ end their constitu@@ tion to have a constitu@@ tional pro@@ vision that allows for special development regi@@ ons .
In a country which had just gone through this w@@ ren@@ ching crisis , the vote in the con@@ gr@@ ess in fav@@ or of this constitu@@ tional am@@ end@@ ment was 1@@ 24 to one .
All parties , all fac@@ tions in society , b@@ acked this .
To be part of the constitu@@ tion , you actually have to pass it twice in the con@@ gr@@ ess .
On Fe@@ bru@@ ary 17@@ th they passed it again with another vote of 1@@ 14 to one .
Im@@ medi@@ ately after that vote , on Fe@@ bru@@ ary 21@@ st to the 2@@ 4@@ th , a del@@ eg@@ ation of about 30 H@@ on@@ dur@@ ans went to the two places in the world that are most interested in getting into the city building business .
One is South Kore@@ a .
This is a picture of a big , new city center that &apos;s being built in South Kore@@ a -- bigger than down@@ town Boston .
Everything you see there was built in four years , after they spent four years getting the per@@ m@@ its .
The other place that &apos;s very interested in city building is Sing@@ apo@@ re .
They &apos;ve actually built two cities already in China and are prepar@@ ing the third .
So if you think about this prac@@ tically , here &apos;s where we are .
They &apos;ve got a site ; they &apos;re already thinking about this site for the second city .
They &apos;re putting in place a legal system that could allow for manag@@ ers to come in , and also an ex@@ tern@@ al legal system .
One country has already volunte@@ ered to let its su@@ pre@@ me court be the court of final appe@@ al for the new ju@@ di@@ ci@@ al system there .
There &apos;s designers and buil@@ ders of cities who are very interested .
They even can bring with them some financ@@ ing .
But the one thing you know they &apos;ve already solved is that there &apos;s lots of ten@@ ants .
There &apos;s lots of businesses that would like to loc@@ ate in the Americ@@ as , especially in a place with a free trade zone , and there &apos;s lots of people who &apos;d like to go there .
Ar@@ ound the world , there &apos;s 700 million people who say they &apos;d like to move perman@@ ently some@@ place else right now .
There &apos;s a million a year who leave L@@ atin America to go to the United States .
Many of these are a father who has to leave his family behind to go get a job -- sometimes a single mother who has to get enough money to even pay for food or clo@@ thing .
S@@ ad@@ ly , sometimes there are even children who are trying to get re@@ un@@ ited with their parents that they haven &apos;t seen , in some cases , for a decade .
So what kind of an idea is it to think about building a brand new city in H@@ on@@ dur@@ as ?
Or to build a do@@ zen of these , or a hundred of these , around the world ?
What kind of an idea is it to think about ins@@ is@@ ting that every family have a choice of several cities that are comp@@ eting to attr@@ act new res@@ id@@ ents ?
This is an idea worth sp@@ reading .
And my friends from H@@ on@@ dur@@ as asked me to say thank you , TED .
I &apos;m J@@ es@@ si , and this is my su@@ it@@ case .
But before I show you what I &apos;ve got inside , I &apos;m going to make a very public conf@@ ession , and that is , I &apos;m out@@ f@@ it-@@ obs@@ essed .
I love finding , wearing , and more recently , photograph@@ ing and b@@ log@@ ging a different , color@@ ful , crazy out@@ fit for every single occasion .
But I don &apos;t buy anything new .
I get all my clo@@ thes second@@ hand from fle@@ a markets and th@@ ri@@ ft stor@@ es .
A@@ w@@ w , thank you .
Sec@@ ond@@ hand sh@@ op@@ ping allows me to reduce the impact my war@@ dro@@ be has on the environment and on my w@@ all@@ et .
I get to meet all kinds of great people ; my dollars usually go to a good cause ; I look pretty unique ; and it makes sh@@ op@@ ping like my own personal tre@@ a@@ sure hun@@ t .
I mean , what am I going to find today ?
Is it going to be my size ?
Will I like the color ?
Will it be under $ 20 ?
If all the answers are yes , I feel as though I &apos;ve won .
I want to get back to my su@@ it@@ case and tell you what I p@@ acked for this exciting week here at TED .
I mean , what does somebody with all these out@@ fits bring with her ?
So I &apos;m going to show you exactly what I brought .
I brought seven pairs of under@@ p@@ ants and that &apos;s it .
Ex@@ actly one week &apos;s worth of un@@ dies is all I put in my su@@ it@@ case .
I was bet@@ ting that I &apos;d be able to find everything else I could possible want to wear once I got here to Pal@@ m S@@ prin@@ gs .
And since you don &apos;t know me as the woman walking around TED in her under@@ wear -- that means I found a few things .
And I &apos;d really love to show you my week &apos;s worth of out@@ fits right now .
Does that sound good ?
So as I do this , I &apos;m also going to tell you a few of the life lessons that , believe it or not , I have picked up in these ad@@ ven@@ tures wearing nothing new .
So let &apos;s start with S@@ un@@ day .
I call this &quot; Sh@@ in@@ y T@@ ig@@ er . &quot;
You do not have to spend a lot of money to look great .
You can almost always look phenomen@@ al for under $ 50 .
This whole out@@ fit , including the j@@ ack@@ et , cost me $ 5@@ 5 , and it was the most expensive thing that I w@@ ore the entire week .
Mon@@ day : Co@@ lo@@ r is powerful .
It is almost physi@@ o@@ log@@ ically impossible to be in a bad mo@@ od when you &apos;re wearing bright red p@@ ants .
If you are happy , you are going to attr@@ act other happy people to you .
Tu@@ es@@ day : F@@ itting in is way over@@ r@@ ated .
I &apos;ve spent a whole lot of my life trying to be myself and at the same time fit in .
Just be who you are .
If you are surr@@ oun@@ ding yourself with the right people , they will not only get it , they will appreci@@ ate it .
W@@ ed@@ n@@ es@@ day : Em@@ br@@ ace your inner child .
Sometimes people tell me that I look like I &apos;m playing dr@@ ess@@ -up , or that I re@@ mind them of their s@@ even@@ -year-old .
I like to s@@ mile and say , &quot; Thank you . &quot;
Th@@ ur@@ s@@ day : Con@@ fi@@ dence is key .
If you think you look good in something , you almost certainly do .
And if you don &apos;t think you look good in something , you &apos;re also probably right .
I grew up with a mom who taught me this d@@ ay@@ -@@ in and d@@ ay@@ -@@ out .
But it wasn &apos;t until I turned 30 that I really got what this meant .
And I &apos;m going to break it down for you for just a second .
If you believe you &apos;re a beautiful person inside and out , there is no look that you can &apos;t pull off .
So there is no ex@@ cu@@ se for any of us here in this audience .
We should be able to rock anything we want to rock .
Thank you .
Fri@@ day : A universal truth -- five words for you : G@@ old se@@ qu@@ ins go with everything .
And finally , Satur@@ day : Dev@@ elop@@ ing your own unique personal style is a really great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word .
It &apos;s been pro@@ ven to me time and time again as people have walked up to me this week simply because of what I &apos;m wearing , and we &apos;ve had great conversations .
So obviously this is not all going to fit back in my tiny su@@ it@@ case .
So before I go home to Bro@@ ok@@ ly@@ n , I &apos;m going to don@@ ate everything back .
Because the lesson I &apos;m trying to learn myself this week is that it &apos;s okay to let go .
I don &apos;t need to get emo@@ tion@@ ally atta@@ ched to these things because around the corner , there is always going to be another crazy , color@@ ful , sh@@ in@@ y out@@ fit just waiting for me , if I put a little love in my heart and look .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
This is a repres@@ entation of your brain , and your brain can be broken into two parts .
There &apos;s the left half , which is the logical side , and then the right half , which is the intu@@ itive .
And so if we had a scale to measure the ap@@ ti@@ tu@@ de of each h@@ emis@@ ph@@ ere , then we can pl@@ ot our brain .
And for example , this would be somebody who &apos;s completely logical .
This would be someone who &apos;s entirely intu@@ itive .
So where would you put your brain on this scale ?
Some of us may have op@@ ted for one of these extre@@ mes , but I think for most people in the audience , your brain is something like this -- with a high ap@@ ti@@ tu@@ de in both h@@ emis@@ ph@@ er@@ es at the same time .
It &apos;s not like they &apos;re mu@@ tually exclu@@ sive or anything .
You can be logical and intu@@ itive .
And so I consider myself one of these people , along with most of the other experim@@ ental quantum physi@@ cis@@ ts , who need a good deal of logic to str@@ ing together these complex ideas .
But at the same time , we need a good deal of intuition to actually make the experiments work .
How do we develop this intuition ? Well we like to play with stuff .
So we go out and play with it , and then we see how it acts , and then we develop our intuition from there .
And really you do the same thing .
So some intuition that you may have developed over the years is that one thing is only in one place at a time .
I mean , it can sound weird to think about one thing being in two different places at the same time , but you weren &apos;t born with this notion , you developed it .
And I remember watching a kid playing on a car stop .
He was just a to@@ dd@@ ler and he wasn &apos;t very good at it , and he kept fall@@ ing over .
But I bet playing with this car stop taught him a really valuable lesson , and that &apos;s that large things don &apos;t let you get right past them , and that they stay in one place .
And so this is a great concep@@ tual model to have of the world , unless you &apos;re a parti@@ cle physi@@ c@@ ist .
It &apos;d be a terrible model for a parti@@ cle physi@@ c@@ ist , because they don &apos;t play with car stop@@ s , they play with these little weird particles .
And when they play with their particles , they find they do all sorts of really weird things -- like they can fly right through walls , or they can be in two different places at the same time .
And so they wrote down all these observ@@ ations , and they called it the theory of quantum mechan@@ ics .
And so that &apos;s where physics was at a few years ago ; you needed quantum mechan@@ ics to describe little , tiny particles .
But you didn &apos;t need it to describe the large , everyday objects around us .
This didn &apos;t really sit well with my intuition , and maybe it &apos;s just because I don &apos;t play with particles very often .
Well , I play with them sometimes , but not very often .
And I &apos;ve never seen them .
I mean , nobody &apos;s ever seen a parti@@ cle .
But it didn &apos;t sit well with my logical side either .
Because if everything is made up of little particles and all the little particles follow quantum mechan@@ ics , then shouldn &apos;t everything just follow quantum mechan@@ ics ?
I don &apos;t see any reason why it shouldn &apos;t .
And so I &apos;d feel a lot better about the whole thing if we could somehow show that an everyday object also fol@@ lows quantum mechan@@ ics .
So a few years ago , I set off to do just that .
So I made one .
This is the first object that you can see that has been in a mechan@@ ical quantum super@@ position .
So what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chi@@ p .
And you can sort of see this green do@@ t right in the middle .
And that &apos;s this piece of met@@ al I &apos;m going to be talking about in a minute .
This is a photograph of the object .
And here I &apos;ll zo@@ om in a little bit . We &apos;re looking right there in the center .
And then here &apos;s a really , really big clo@@ se-@@ up of the little piece of met@@ al .
So what we &apos;re looking at is a little ch@@ un@@ k of met@@ al , and it &apos;s shap@@ ed like a di@@ ving board , and it &apos;s stic@@ king out over a le@@ dge .
And so I made this thing in nearly the same way as you make a computer chi@@ p .
I went into a clean room with a fresh si@@ licon w@@ af@@ er , and then I just cr@@ an@@ ked away at all the big machines for about 100 hours .
For the last stuff , I had to build my own machine -- to make this swim@@ ming po@@ ol@@ -@@ shap@@ ed hole underneath the device .
This device has the ability to be in a quantum super@@ position , but it needs a little help to do it .
Here , let me give you an analo@@ g@@ y .
You know how un@@ comfortable it is to be in a crow@@ ded el@@ ev@@ ator ?
I mean , when I &apos;m in an el@@ ev@@ ator all alone , I do all sorts of weird things , but then other people get on board and I stop doing those things because I don &apos;t want to bo@@ ther them , or , fran@@ kly , sc@@ are them .
So quantum mechan@@ ics says that in@@ anim@@ ate objects feel the same way .
The fellow pass@@ eng@@ ers for in@@ anim@@ ate objects are not just people , but it &apos;s also the light sh@@ in@@ ing on it and the wind blo@@ wing past it and the heat of the room .
And so we knew , if we wanted to see this piece of met@@ al be@@ have quantum mechan@@ ically , we &apos;re going to have to k@@ ick out all the other pass@@ eng@@ ers .
And so that &apos;s what we did .
We turned off the lights , and then we put it in a vac@@ u@@ um and suc@@ ked out all the air , and then we co@@ ol@@ ed it down to just a fr@@ action of a degree above absolute zero .
Now , all alone in the el@@ ev@@ ator , the little ch@@ un@@ k of met@@ al is free to act how@@ ever it wanted .
And so we measu@@ red its motion .
We found it was moving in really weird ways .
Instead of just sitting perfectly still , it was vibr@@ ating , and the way it was vibr@@ ating was brea@@ thing something like this -- like exp@@ anding and contr@@ acting bel@@ lows .
And by giving it a gent@@ le nu@@ dge , we were able to make it both vibr@@ ate and not vibr@@ ate at the same time -- something that &apos;s only allowed with quantum mechan@@ ics .
So what I &apos;m telling you here is something truly fantastic .
What does it mean for one thing to be both vibr@@ ating and not vibr@@ ating at the same time ?
So let &apos;s think about the at@@ oms .
So in one case : all the trilli@@ ons of at@@ oms that make up that ch@@ un@@ k of met@@ al are sitting still and at the same time those same at@@ oms are moving up and down .
Now it &apos;s only at pre@@ c@@ ise times when they al@@ ign .
The rest of the time they &apos;re del@@ oc@@ alized .
That means that every at@@ om is in two different places at the same time , which in turn means the entire ch@@ un@@ k of met@@ al is in two different places .
I think this is really cool .
Re@@ ally .
It was worth loc@@ king myself in a clean room to do this for all those years because , check this out , the difference in scale between a single at@@ om and that ch@@ un@@ k of met@@ al is about the same as the difference between that ch@@ un@@ k of met@@ al and you .
So if a single at@@ om can be in two different places at the same time , that ch@@ un@@ k of met@@ al can be in two different places , then why not you ?
I mean , this is just my logical side talking .
So imagine if you &apos;re in multiple places at the same time , what would that be like ?
How would your consciousness hand@@ le your body being del@@ oc@@ alized in space ?
There &apos;s one more part to the story .
It &apos;s when we warm@@ ed it up , and we turned on the lights and looked inside the box , we saw that the piece met@@ al was still there in one piece .
And so I had to develop this new intuition , that it seems like all the objects in the el@@ ev@@ ator are really just quantum objects just cr@@ am@@ med into a tiny space .
You hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechan@@ ics says that everything is all inter@@ connected .
Well , that &apos;s not quite right .
It &apos;s more than that ; it &apos;s deeper .
It &apos;s that those connections , your connections to all the things around you , literally define who you are , and that &apos;s the profound we@@ ir@@ d@@ ness of quantum mechan@@ ics .
Thank you .
My name is Am@@ it .
And 18 months ago , I had another job at Google , and I pit@@ ched this idea of doing something with mus@@ eu@@ ms and art to my bo@@ ss who &apos;s actually here , and she allowed me to do it .
And it took 18 months .
A lot of fun , negoti@@ ations and stories , I can tell you , with 17 very interesting mus@@ eu@@ ms from nine countries .
But I &apos;m going to focus on the dem@@ o .
There are a lot of stories about why we did this .
I think my personal story is expl@@ ained very simply on the slide , and it &apos;s access .
And I grew up in India .
I had a great education -- I &apos;m not compl@@ aining -- but I didn &apos;t have access to a lot of these mus@@ eu@@ ms and these art@@ works .
And so when I started trav@@ eling and going to these mus@@ eu@@ ms , I started learning a lot .
And while working at Google , I tried to put this desire to make it more accessible with technology together .
So we formed a team , a great team of people , and we started doing this .
I &apos;m going to probably get into the dem@@ o and then tell you a couple of the interesting things we &apos;ve had since laun@@ ch .
So , simple : you come to Goo@@ g@@ le@@ Ar@@ t@@ Proj@@ ect@@ .com .
You look around at all these mus@@ eu@@ ms here .
You &apos;ve got the U@@ ff@@ iz@@ i , you &apos;ve got the Mo@@ M@@ A , the Her@@ mit@@ age , the Ri@@ j@@ ks , the V@@ an Go@@ gh .
I &apos;m going to actually get to one of my favor@@ ites , the Me@@ tro@@ po@@ lit@@ an Museum of Art in New York .
Two ways of going in -- very simple .
C@@ lic@@ k and , ban@@ g , you &apos;re in this museum .
It doesn &apos;t matter where you are -- B@@ omb@@ ay , Mexico , it doesn &apos;t really matter .
You move around , you have fun .
You want to navig@@ ate around the museum ?
O@@ pen the plan up , and , in one click , jump .
You &apos;re in there , you want to go to the end of the cor@@ ri@@ d@@ or .
Ke@@ ep going . Have fun .
Ex@@ pl@@ ore .
Thanks . I haven &apos;t come to the best part .
So now I &apos;m in front of one of my favorite pain@@ t@@ ings , &quot; The Harv@@ es@@ ters &quot; by Pi@@ eter B@@ ru@@ eg@@ el at the M@@ et .
I see this plus sign .
If the museum has given us the image , you click on it .
Now this is one of the images .
So this is all of the met@@ a-@@ data information .
For those of you who are truly interested in art , you can click this -- but I &apos;m going to click this off right now .
And this is one of these images that we cap@@ tured in what we call gig@@ ap@@ i@@ x@@ el technology .
So this image , for example , has close to , I think , around 10 billion pi@@ x@@ els .
And I get a lot of people asking me : &quot; What do you get for 10 billion pi@@ x@@ els ? &quot;
So I &apos;m going to try and show you what you really get for 10 billion pi@@ x@@ els .
You can zo@@ om around very simply .
You see some fun stuff happening here .
I love this guy ; his expression is pr@@ ic@@ eless .
But then you really want to go deep .
And so I started playing around , and I found something going on over here .
And I was like , &quot; H@@ old on . That sounds interesting . &quot;
W@@ ent in , and I started notic@@ ing that these kids were actually be@@ ating something .
I did a little research , spoke to a couple of my cont@@ acts at the M@@ et , and actually found out that this is a game which invol@@ ves be@@ ating a go@@ ose with a stick on Sh@@ ro@@ ve Tu@@ es@@ day .
And appar@@ ently it was quite popular .
I don &apos;t know why they did it , but I learned something about it .
Now just to get really deep in , you can really get to the cr@@ acks .
Now just to give you some perspective , I &apos;m going to zo@@ om out so you really see what you get .
Here is where we were , and this is the painting .
The best is yet to come -- so in a second .
So now let &apos;s just quickly jump into the Mo@@ M@@ A , again in New York .
So another one of my favor@@ ites , &quot; The St@@ arry N@@ ight . &quot;
Now the example I showed you was all about finding details .
But what if you want to see br@@ ush str@@ o@@ kes ?
And what if you want to see how V@@ an Go@@ gh actually created this mas@@ ter@@ piece ?
You zo@@ om in . You really go in .
I &apos;m going to go to one of my favorite parts in this painting , and I &apos;m really going to get to the cr@@ acks .
This is &quot; The St@@ arry N@@ ight , &quot; I think , never seen like this before .
I &apos;m going to show you my other favorite fe@@ ature .
There &apos;s a lot of other stuff here , but I don &apos;t have time .
This is the real cool part . It &apos;s called C@@ oll@@ ections .
An@@ y one of you , anybody -- doesn &apos;t matter if you &apos;re rich , if you &apos;re poor , if you have a f@@ ancy house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
You can go and create your own museum online -- create your own collection across all these images .
Very simply , you go in -- and I &apos;ve created this , called The Po@@ wer of Z@@ o@@ om -- you can just zo@@ om around .
This is &quot; The Am@@ b@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors , &quot; based in the National G@@ all@@ ery .
You can ann@@ ot@@ ate the stuff , send it to your friends and really get a conversation going about what you &apos;re feeling when you go through these mas@@ ter@@ pieces .
So I think , in conclusion , for me , the main thing is that all the amazing stuff here does not really come from Google .
It doesn &apos;t , in my opinion , even come from the mus@@ eu@@ ms .
I probably shouldn &apos;t say that .
It really comes from these artists .
And that &apos;s been my hum@@ bling experience in this .
I mean , I hope in this digital medi@@ um that we do justice to their art@@ work and represent it proper@@ ly online .
And the biggest question I get asked now@@ ad@@ ays is , &quot; Did you do this to replic@@ ate the experience of going to a museum ? &quot;
And the answer is no .
It &apos;s to sup@@ pl@@ ement the experience .
And that &apos;s it . Thank you .
Thank you .
Good after@@ no@@ on , everybody .
I &apos;ve got something to show you .
Think about this as a pi@@ x@@ el , a flying pi@@ x@@ el .
This is what we call , in our lab , sensi@@ ble design .
Let me tell you a bit about it .
Now if you take this picture -- I &apos;m Ital@@ ian origin@@ ally , and every boy in Ital@@ y gro@@ ws up with this picture on the wall of his be@@ dro@@ om -- but the reason I &apos;m showing you this is that something very interesting happened in For@@ mu@@ la 1 rac@@ ing over the past couple of decades .
Now some time ago , if you wanted to win a For@@ mu@@ la 1 race , you take a budget , and you bet your budget on a good driver and a good car .
And if the car and the driver were good enough , then you &apos;d win the race .
Now today , if you want to win the race , actually you need also something like this -- something that monit@@ ors the car in real time , has a few thousand sens@@ ors collec@@ ting information from the car , trans@@ m@@ itting this information into the system , and then proc@@ essing it and using it in order to go back to the car with decisions and changing things in real time as information is coll@@ ected .
This is what , in engineering terms , you would call a real time control system .
And basically , it &apos;s a system made of two compon@@ ents -- a sen@@ sing and an actu@@ ating compon@@ ent .
What is interesting today is that real time control systems are starting to enter into our lives .
Our cities , over the past few years , just have been blan@@ ket@@ ed with networks , electron@@ ics .
They &apos;re becoming like computers in open air .
And , as computers in open air , they &apos;re starting to respond in a different way to be able to be sens@@ ed and to be actu@@ ated .
If we fix cities , actually it &apos;s a big deal .
Just as an as@@ ide , I wanted to mention , cities are only two percent of the Earth &apos;s cr@@ ust , but they are 50 percent of the world &apos;s population .
They are 75 percent of the energy consumption -- up to 80 percent of CO2 emissions .
So if we &apos;re able to do something with cities , that &apos;s a big deal .
B@@ ey@@ ond cities , all of this sen@@ sing and actu@@ ating is ent@@ ering our everyday objects .
That &apos;s from an exhi@@ bi@@ tion that P@@ a@@ o@@ la An@@ ton@@ ell@@ i is organiz@@ ing at Mo@@ M@@ A later this year , during the summer .
It &apos;s called &quot; Talk to M@@ e . &quot;
Well our objects , our environment is starting to talk back to us .
In a certain sense , it &apos;s almost as if every at@@ om out there were becoming both a sens@@ or and an actu@@ ator .
And that is radic@@ ally changing the interaction we have as humans with the environment out there .
In a certain sense , it &apos;s almost as if the old dream of Mich@@ el@@ ang@@ el@@ o ...
you know , when Mich@@ el@@ ang@@ el@@ o sculp@@ ted the Mo@@ ses , at the end it said that he took the ham@@ mer , thre@@ w it at the Mo@@ ses -- actually you can still see a small chi@@ p underneath -- and said , sh@@ ou@@ ted , &quot; Per@@ ch@@ é non par@@ l@@ i ? Why don &apos;t you talk ? &quot;
Well today , for the first time , our environment is starting to talk back to us .
And I &apos;ll show just a few examples -- again , with this idea of sen@@ sing our environment and actu@@ ating it .
Let &apos;s starting with sen@@ sing .
Well , the first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects by our lab .
It was four and a half years ago in Ital@@ y .
And what we did there was actually use a new type of network at the time that had been depl@@ oy@@ ed all across the world -- that &apos;s a cell@@ phone network -- and use anony@@ m@@ ous and ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ated information from that network , that &apos;s coll@@ ected anyway by the oper@@ ator , in order to understand how the city works .
The summer was a lucky summer -- 2006 .
It &apos;s when Ital@@ y won the so@@ c@@ cer World C@@ up .
Some of you might remember , it was Ital@@ y and France playing , and then Z@@ id@@ ane at the end , the head@@ but@@ t .
And anyway , Ital@@ y won at the end .
Now look at what happened that day just by monit@@ or@@ ing activity happening on the network .
Here you see the city .
You see the Co@@ lo@@ ss@@ eum in the middle , the river Ti@@ ber .
It &apos;s morning , before the match .
You see the tim@@ el@@ ine on the top .
Ear@@ ly after@@ no@@ on , people here and there , making calls and moving .
The match begins -- silence .
France s@@ cor@@ es . Ital@@ y s@@ cor@@ es .
H@@ al@@ f@@ time , people make a quick call and go to the b@@ ath@@ room .
Second half . E@@ nd of normal time .
First over@@ time , second .
Z@@ id@@ ane , the head@@ but@@ t in a moment .
Ital@@ y w@@ ins . Yeah .
Well , that night , everybody went to celebr@@ ate in the center .
You saw the big pea@@ k .
The following day , again everybody went to the center to meet the win@@ ning team and the prime min@@ ister at the time .
And then everybody moved down .
You see the image of the place called C@@ ir@@ co Mas@@ sim@@ o , where , since Rom@@ an times , people go to celebr@@ ate , to have a big party , and you see the pea@@ k at the end of the day .
Well , that &apos;s just one example of how we can sense the city today in a way that we couldn &apos;t have done just a few years ago .
Another quick example about sen@@ sing : it &apos;s not about people , but about things we use and consu@@ me .
Well today , we know everything about where our objects come from .
This is a map that shows you all the chi@@ ps that form a Ma@@ c computer , how they came together .
But we know very little about where things go .
So in this project , we actually developed some small t@@ ags to track tr@@ ash as it moves through the system .
So we actually started with a number of volunte@@ ers who helped us in Se@@ at@@ tle , just over a year ago , to ta@@ g what they were thro@@ wing away -- different types of things , as you can see here -- things they would throw away anyway .
Then we put a little chi@@ p , little ta@@ g , onto the tr@@ ash and then started following it .
Here are the results we just ob@@ t@@ ained .
From Se@@ at@@ tle ...
after one week .
With this information we realized there &apos;s a lot of in@@ effici@@ encies in the system .
We can actually do the same thing with much less energy .
This data was not available before .
But there &apos;s a lot of was@@ ted transport@@ ation and con@@ volu@@ ted things happening .
But the other thing is that we believe that if we see every day that the cu@@ p we &apos;re thro@@ wing away , it doesn &apos;t dis@@ appear , it &apos;s still somewhere on the planet .
And the plastic bot@@ tle we &apos;re thro@@ wing away every day still st@@ ays there .
And if we show that to people , then we can also prom@@ ote some behavi@@ oral change .
So that was the reason for the project .
My colle@@ ague at MIT , A@@ ss@@ a@@ f Bi@@ der@@ man , he could tell you much more about sen@@ sing and many other wonderful things we can do with sen@@ sing , but I wanted to go to the second part we discus@@ sed at the beginning , and that &apos;s actu@@ ating our environment .
And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in Z@@ ar@@ ag@@ o@@ z@@ a , S@@ pain .
It started with a question by the may@@ or of the city , who came to us saying that S@@ pain and Sou@@ thern Europe have a beautiful tradition of using water in public space , in architecture .
And the question was : How could technology , new technology , be ad@@ ded to that ?
And one of the ideas that was developed at MIT in a work@@ shop was , imagine this pi@@ pe , and you &apos;ve got val@@ ves , sol@@ en@@ oid val@@ ves , t@@ aps , opening and clo@@ sing .
You create like a water cur@@ t@@ ain with pi@@ x@@ els made of water .
If those pi@@ x@@ els fall , you can write on it , you can show patterns , images , text .
And even you can approach it , and it will open up to let you jump through , as you see in this image .
Well , we pres@@ ented this to May@@ or B@@ el@@ lo@@ ch .
He liked it very much .
And we got a comm@@ ission to design a building at the entr@@ ance of the exp@@ o .
We called it D@@ ig@@ ital W@@ ater P@@ av@@ ili@@ on .
The whole building is made of water .
There &apos;s no do@@ ors or windo@@ ws , but when you approach it , it will open up to let you in .
The ro@@ of also is covered with water .
And if there &apos;s a bit of wind , if you want to minim@@ ize s@@ pl@@ ash@@ ing , you can actually lower the ro@@ of .
Or you could close the building , and the whole architecture will dis@@ appear , like in this case .
You know , these days , you always get images during the win@@ ter , when they take the ro@@ of down , of people who have been there and said , &quot; They dem@@ ol@@ ished the building . &quot;
No , they didn &apos;t dem@@ ol@@ ish it , just when it goes down , the architecture almost dis@@ appe@@ ars .
Here &apos;s the building working .
You see the person puzz@@ led about what was going on inside .
And here was myself trying not to get w@@ et , testing the sens@@ ors that open the water .
Well , I should tell you now what happened one night when all of the sens@@ ors stopped working .
But actually that night , it was even more fun .
All the kids from Z@@ ar@@ ag@@ o@@ z@@ a came to the building , because the way of engag@@ ing with the building became something different .
Not anymore a building that would open up to let you in , but a building that would still make cu@@ ts and holes through the water , and you had to jump without getting w@@ et .
And that was , for us , was very interesting , because , as archit@@ ects , as engineers , as designers , we always think about how people will use the things we design .
But then reality &apos;s always un@@ predic@@ table .
And that &apos;s the beauty of doing things that are used and interact with people .
Here is an image then of the building with the physical pi@@ x@@ els , the pi@@ x@@ els made of water , and then proj@@ ections on them .
And this is what led us to think about the following project I &apos;ll show you now .
That &apos;s , imagine those pi@@ x@@ els could actually start flying .
Imagine you could have small hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ters that move in the air , and then each of them with a small pi@@ x@@ el in changing lights -- almost as a cloud that can move in space .
Here is the video .
So imagine one hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter , like the one we saw before , moving with others , in syn@@ chron@@ y .
So you can have this cloud .
You can have a kind of flex@@ ible screen or dis@@ play , like this -- a regular con@@ figur@@ ation in two dimensions .
Or in regular , but in three dimensions , where the thing that changes is the light , not the pi@@ x@@ els &apos; position .
You can play with a different type .
Imagine your screen could just appear in different sc@@ ales or si@@ zes , different types of resol@@ ution .
But then the whole thing can be just a 3D cloud of pi@@ x@@ els that you can approach and move through it and see from many , many directions .
Here is the real F@@ ly@@ fire control and going down to form the regular gri@@ d as before .
When you turn on the light , actually you see this . So the same as we saw before .
And imagine each of them then controlled by people .
You can have each pi@@ x@@ el having an in@@ put that comes from people , from people &apos;s movement , or so and so .
I want to show you something here for the first time .
We &apos;ve been working with Rob@@ er@@ to B@@ ol@@ le , one of today &apos;s top ball@@ et d@@ anc@@ ers -- the é@@ t@@ o@@ ile at Me@@ tro@@ po@@ lit@@ an in New York and La S@@ cal@@ a in Mil@@ an -- and actually cap@@ tured his movement in 3D in order to use it as an in@@ put for F@@ ly@@ fire .
And here you can see Rob@@ er@@ to d@@ ancing .
You see on the left the pi@@ x@@ els , the different resol@@ u@@ tions being cap@@ tured .
It &apos;s both 3D scann@@ ing in real time and motion capture .
So you can re@@ construc@@ t a whole movement .
You can go all the way through .
But then , once we have the pi@@ x@@ els , then you can play with them and play with color and movement and grav@@ ity and rot@@ ation .
So we want to use this as one of the possible in@@ puts for F@@ ly@@ fire .
I wanted to show you the last project we are working on .
It &apos;s something we &apos;re working on for the London O@@ lym@@ pic@@ s .
It &apos;s called The Cl@@ oud .
And the idea here is , imagine , again , we can invol@@ ve people in doing something and changing our environment -- almost to im@@ part what we call cloud rais@@ ing -- like bar@@ n rais@@ ing , but with a cloud .
Imagine you can have everybody make a small don@@ ation for one pi@@ x@@ el .
And I think what is remarkable that has happened over the past couple of years is that , over the past couple of decades , we went from the physical world to the digital one .
This has been di@@ gi@@ tiz@@ ing everything , knowledge , and making that accessible through the Internet .
Now today , for the first time -- and the Obama campaign showed us this -- we can go from the digital world , from the self-@@ organiz@@ ing power of networks , to the physical one .
This can be , in our case , we want to use it for designing and doing a symbo@@ l .
That means something built in a city .
But tomorrow it can be , in order to t@@ ack@@ le today &apos;s pr@@ essing challenges -- think about climate change or CO2 emissions -- how we can go from the digital world to the physical one .
So the idea that we can actually invol@@ ve people in doing this thing together , collec@@ tively .
The cloud is a cloud , again , made of pi@@ x@@ els , in the same way as the real cloud is a cloud made of particles .
And those particles are water , where our cloud is a cloud of pi@@ x@@ els .
It &apos;s a physical structure in London , but covered with pi@@ x@@ els .
You can move inside , have different types of experiences .
You can actually see from underneath , sharing the main moments for the O@@ lym@@ pic@@ s in 2012 and beyond , and really using it as a way to connect with the community .
So both the physical cloud in the sky and something you can go to the top &#91; of &#93; , like London &apos;s new mount@@ ain@@ top .
You can enter inside it .
And a kind of new digital be@@ ac@@ on for the night -- but most importantly , a new type of experience for anybody who will go to the top .
Thank you .
How would you like to be better than you are ?
Su@@ p@@ pose I said that , with just a few changes in your genes , you could get a better memory -- more pre@@ c@@ ise , more accur@@ ate and qu@@ ic@@ ker .
Or maybe you &apos;d like to be more fit , strong@@ er , with more st@@ am@@ ina .
Would you like to be more attr@@ active and self-@@ confi@@ dent ?
How about living longer with good health ?
Or perhaps you &apos;re one of those who &apos;s always year@@ ned for more creativity .
Which one would you like the most ?
Which would you like , if you could have just one ?
C@@ re@@ ativity .
How many people would choose creativity ?
R@@ aise your hands . Let me see .
A few . P@@ rob@@ ably about as many as there are creative people here .
That &apos;s very good .
How many would op@@ t for memory ?
Qu@@ ite a few more .
How about f@@ it@@ ness ?
A few less .
What about long@@ ev@@ ity ?
Ah , the majority . That makes me feel very good as a doctor .
If you could have any one of these , it would be a very different world .
Is it just imagin@@ ary ?
Or , is it , perhaps , possible ?
E@@ volution has been a per@@ enni@@ al top@@ ic here at the TED Con@@ ference , but I want to give you today one doctor &apos;s take on the subject .
The great 20@@ th-@@ century gene@@ tic@@ ist , T@@ .@@ G@@ . D@@ ob@@ z@@ h@@ ans@@ ky , who was also a communic@@ ant in the Rus@@ sian Or@@ tho@@ do@@ x C@@ hur@@ ch , once wrote an ess@@ ay that he tit@@ led &quot; No@@ thing in Bi@@ ology Ma@@ kes S@@ ense Ex@@ cept in the L@@ ight of E@@ volution . &quot;
Now if you are one of those who does not accept the evidence for biological evolution , this would be a very good time to turn off your hearing aid , take out your personal communications device -- I give you per@@ mission -- and perhaps take another look at K@@ a@@ thr@@ yn Sch@@ ul@@ t@@ z &apos;s book on being wrong , because nothing in the rest of this talk is going to make any sense what@@ so@@ ever to you .
But if you do accept biological evolution , consider this : is it just about the past , or is it about the future ?
Does it apply to others , or does it apply to us ?
This is another look at the tree of life .
In this picture , I &apos;ve put a bus@@ h with a center bran@@ ching out in all directions , because if you look at the ed@@ ges of the tree of life , every existing species at the ti@@ ps of those bran@@ ches has succe@@ e@@ ded in evolutionary terms : it has surviv@@ ed ; it has demonstr@@ ated a f@@ it@@ ness to its environment .
The human part of this bran@@ ch , way out on one end , is , of course , the one that we are most interested in .
We bran@@ ch off of a common ancest@@ or to modern chimpanz@@ ees about six or eight million years ago .
In the inter@@ v@@ al , there have been perhaps 20 or 25 different species of hom@@ in@@ ids .
Some have come and gone .
We have been here for about 1@@ 3@@ 0,000 years .
It may seem like we &apos;re quite remote from other parts of this tree of life , but actually , for the most part , the basic mach@@ in@@ ery of our cells is pretty much the same .
Do you realize that we can take advantage and comman@@ de@@ er the mach@@ in@@ ery of a common bacter@@ ium to produce the protein of human in@@ su@@ lin used to treat di@@ abe@@ tics ?
This is not like human in@@ su@@ lin ; this is the same protein that is chem@@ ically in@@ distin@@ gu@@ ish@@ able from what comes out of your pan@@ cre@@ as .
And speaking of bacteria , do you realize that each of us car@@ ries in our g@@ ut more bacteria than there are cells in the rest of our body ?
Maybe 10 times more .
I mean think of it , when An@@ ton@@ i@@ o D@@ am@@ as@@ i@@ o asks about your self-@@ image , do you think about the bacteria ?
Our g@@ ut is a wonder@@ fully hosp@@ itable environment for those bacteria .
It &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s mo@@ ist , it &apos;s very co@@ z@@ y .
And you &apos;re going to provide all the nutrition that they could possibly want with no effort on their part .
It &apos;s really like an E@@ as@@ y Street for bacteria , with the occas@@ i@@ onal inter@@ ru@@ ption of the un@@ int@@ ended forced r@@ ush to the ex@@ it .
But otherwise , you are a wonderful environment for those bacteria , just as they are essential to your life .
They help in the dig@@ es@@ tion of essential nutri@@ ents , and they protect you against certain diseases .
But what will come in the future ?
Are we at some kind of evolutionary equi@@ po@@ ise as a species ?
Or , are we destin@@ ed to become something different -- something , perhaps , even better adap@@ ted to the environment ?
Now let &apos;s take a step back in time to the Big Bang , 14 billion years ago -- the Earth , the solar system , about four and a half billion years -- the first signs of prot@@ o-@@ life , maybe three to four billion years ago on Earth -- the first multi-@@ cel@@ led organisms , perhaps as much as 800 or a billion years ago -- and then the human species , finally emerging in the last 1@@ 3@@ 0,000 years .
In this vast un@@ finished sym@@ ph@@ ony of the universe , life on Earth is like a bri@@ ef measure ; the animal k@@ ing@@ dom , like a single measure ; and human life , a small gr@@ ace note .
That was us .
That also constitu@@ tes the entert@@ ain@@ ment por@@ tion of this talk , so I hope you enjo@@ yed it .
Now when I was a fres@@ h@@ man in college , I took my first biology class .
I was fascin@@ ated by the el@@ eg@@ ance and beauty of biology .
I became en@@ a@@ mo@@ red of the power of evolution , and I realized something very fundamental : in most of the existence of life in sing@@ le-@@ cel@@ led organisms , each cell simply divi@@ des , and all of the genetic energy of that cell is car@@ ried on in both daughter cells .
But at the time multi-@@ cel@@ led organisms come online , things start to change .
S@@ exu@@ al re@@ production ent@@ ers the picture .
And very importantly , with the intro@@ duction of sexual re@@ production that pas@@ ses on the genome , the rest of the body becomes exp@@ end@@ able .
In fact , you could say that the in@@ ev@@ it@@ ability of the death of our bodies ent@@ ers in evolutionary time at the same moment as sexual re@@ production .
Now I have to conf@@ ess , when I was a college under@@ graduate , I thought , okay , sex / death , sex / death , death for sex -- it seemed pretty reas@@ on@@ able at the time , but with each pass@@ ing year , I &apos;ve come to have increasing doub@@ ts .
I &apos;ve come to understand the sentiments of George Bur@@ ns , who was perform@@ ing still in L@@ as V@@ eg@@ as well into his 9@@ 0s .
And one night , there &apos;s a kno@@ ck at his hot@@ el room door .
He answers the door .
St@@ anding before him is a gor@@ ge@@ ous , sc@@ anti@@ ly cl@@ ad sho@@ w@@ girl .
She looks at him and says , &quot; I &apos;m here for super sex . &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s fine , &quot; says George , &quot; I &apos;ll take the sou@@ p . &quot;
I came to realize , as a physici@@ an , that I was working toward a goal which was different from the goal of evolution -- not necessarily contra@@ dic@@ t@@ ory , just different .
I was trying to pres@@ erve the body .
I wanted to keep us healthy .
I wanted to res@@ to@@ re health from disease .
I wanted us to live long and healthy lives .
E@@ volution is all about pass@@ ing on the genome to the next generation , adap@@ ting and survi@@ ving through generation after generation .
From an evolutionary point of view , you and I are like the boo@@ ster ro@@ ck@@ ets designed to send the genetic pay@@ load into the next level of or@@ bit and then drop off into the sea .
I think we would all understand the sentiment that W@@ oo@@ dy All@@ en ex@@ pressed when he said , &quot; I don &apos;t want to achieve im@@ mortality through my work .
I want to achieve it through not dying . &quot;
E@@ volution does not necessarily fav@@ or the long@@ est-@@ lived .
It doesn &apos;t necessarily fav@@ or the biggest or the strong@@ est or the fas@@ test , and not even the smar@@ test .
E@@ volution fav@@ ors those creatures best adap@@ ted to their environment .
That is the so@@ le test of survival and success .
At the bottom of the ocean , bacteria that are ther@@ mo@@ ph@@ ili@@ c and can survive at the stea@@ m vent heat that would otherwise produce , if fish were there , sou@@ s-@@ vide coo@@ ked fish , n@@ ever@@ th@@ eless , have managed to make that a hosp@@ itable environment for them .
So what does this mean , as we look back at what has happened in evolution , and as we think about the place again of humans in evolution , and particularly as we look ahead to the next phase , I would say that there are a number of possibilities .
The first is that we will not evol@@ ve .
We have reach@@ ed a kind of equi@@ po@@ ise .
And the reas@@ oning behind that would be , first , we have , through medicine , managed to pres@@ erve a lot of genes that would otherwise be sel@@ ected out and be re@@ moved from the population .
And secon@@ dly , we as a species have so con@@ figured our environment that we have managed to make it adap@@ t to us as well as we adap@@ t to it .
And by the way , we im@@ migr@@ ate and circul@@ ate and inter@@ mi@@ x so much that you can &apos;t any longer have the isol@@ ation that is necessary for evolution to take place .
A second possibility is that there will be evolution of the traditional kind , natural , im@@ posed by the forces of nature .
And the argument here would be that the whe@@ els of evolution gr@@ ind slowly , but they are in@@ ex@@ or@@ able .
And as far as isol@@ ation goes , when we as a species do colon@@ ize dis@@ tant planets , there will be the isol@@ ation and the environmental changes that could produce evolution in the natural way .
But there &apos;s a third possibility , an enti@@ c@@ ing , intrig@@ u@@ ing and fri@@ ghten@@ ing possibility .
I call it ne@@ o-@@ evolution -- the new evolution that is not simply natural , but gu@@ ided and cho@@ sen by us as individuals in the choices that we will make .
Now how could this come about ?
How could it be possible that we would do this ?
Con@@ si@@ der , first , the reality that people today , in some cultures , are making choices about their off@@ spring .
They &apos;re , in some cultures , cho@@ os@@ ing to have more males than fem@@ ales .
It &apos;s not necessarily good for the society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family are cho@@ os@@ ing .
Think also , if it were possible ever for you to choose , not simply to choose the sex of your child , but for you in your body to make the genetic ad@@ just@@ ments that would cure or prevent diseases .
What if you could make the genetic changes to el@@ im@@ in@@ ate diab@@ et@@ es or Alzheimer &apos;s or reduce the risk of cancer or el@@ im@@ in@@ ate str@@ oke ?
W@@ ouldn &apos;t you want to make those changes in your genes ?
If we look ahead , these kind of changes are going to be increasingly possible .
The Hu@@ man Gen@@ ome Project started in 1990 , and it took 13 years .
It cost 2.@@ 7 billion dollars .
The year after it was finished in 2004 , you could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three to four months .
Today , you can have a complete sequence of the three billion base pairs in the human genome at a cost of about 20@@ ,000 dollars and in the space of about a week .
It won &apos;t be very long before the reality will be the 1,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ dollar human genome , and it will be increasingly available for everyone .
Just a week ago , the National Ac@@ adem@@ y of En@@ g@@ ine@@ ering awar@@ ded its D@@ rap@@ er Pri@@ ze to Franc@@ is Ar@@ no@@ ld and Wil@@ lem St@@ em@@ mer , two scientists who in@@ depend@@ ently developed techniques to encourage the natural process of evolution to work faster and to lead to des@@ ir@@ able prot@@ e@@ ins in a more efficient way -- what Fr@@ ances Ar@@ no@@ ld calls &quot; direc@@ ted evolution . &quot;
A couple of years ago , the L@@ as@@ ker Pri@@ ze was awar@@ ded to the scientist Sh@@ in@@ ya Y@@ am@@ an@@ ak@@ a for his research in which he took an adult skin cell , a fi@@ bro@@ bl@@ ast , and by manipul@@ ating just four genes , he in@@ duced that cell to re@@ vert to a plu@@ ri@@ potential stem cell -- a cell potenti@@ ally capable of becoming any cell in your body .
These changes are coming .
The same technology that has produced the human in@@ su@@ lin in bacteria can make viruses that will not only protect you against themselves , but in@@ duce immun@@ ity against other viruses .
B@@ eli@@ eve it or not , there &apos;s an experim@@ ental trial going on with vacc@@ ine against influ@@ enz@@ a that has been grown in the cells of a to@@ b@@ acc@@ o plant .
Can you imagine something good coming out of to@@ b@@ acc@@ o ?
These are all reality today , and &#91; in &#93; the future , will be ever@@ more possible .
Imagine then just two other little changes .
You can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells in your off@@ spring ?
What if you could change the sper@@ m and the o@@ va , or change the new@@ ly fer@@ ti@@ li@@ zed eg@@ g , and give your off@@ spring a better chance at a health@@ ier life -- el@@ im@@ in@@ ate the diab@@ et@@ es , el@@ im@@ in@@ ate the h@@ em@@ ophi@@ li@@ a , reduce the risk of cancer ?
Who doesn &apos;t want health@@ ier children ?
And then , that same analy@@ tic technology , that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent disease , will also en@@ able us to adop@@ t super-@@ attribu@@ tes , hyper@@ -@@ capac@@ i@@ ties -- that better memory .
Why not have the quick w@@ it of a K@@ en J@@ enn@@ ings , especially if you can aug@@ ment it with the next generation of the Wat@@ son machine ?
Why not have the quick t@@ wit@@ ch muscle that will en@@ able you to run faster and longer ?
Why not live longer ?
These will be ir@@ res@@ is@@ tible .
And when we are at a position where we can pass it on to the next generation , and we can adop@@ t the attribu@@ tes we want , we will have conver@@ ted ol@@ d-@@ style evolution into ne@@ o-@@ evolution .
We &apos;ll take a process that normally might require 100,000 years , and we can com@@ press it down to a thousand years -- and maybe even in the next 100 years .
These are choices that your grand@@ children , or their grand@@ children , are going to have before them .
Will we use these choices to make a society that is better , that is more successful , that is kin@@ der ?
Or , will we sel@@ ec@@ tively choose different attribu@@ tes that we want for some of us and not for others of us ?
Will we make a society that is more bor@@ ing and more uni@@ form , or more rob@@ ust and more vers@@ ati@@ le ?
These are the kinds of questions that we will have to face .
And most prof@@ ound@@ ly of all , will we ever be able to develop the wisdom , and to inher@@ it the wisdom , that we &apos;ll need to make these choices wis@@ ely ?
For better or worse , and so@@ on@@ er than you may think , these choices will be up to us .
Thank you .
Imagine a big explosion as you clim@@ b through 3,000 ft .
Imagine a plane full of smo@@ ke .
Imagine an engine going cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack , cl@@ ack .
It sounds scar@@ y .
Well , I had a unique seat that day . I was sitting in 1@@ D .
I was the only one who could talk to the flight attend@@ ants .
So I looked at them right away , and they said , &quot; No problem . We probably hit some birds . &quot;
The pil@@ ot had already turned the plane around , and we weren &apos;t that far .
You could see Manhattan .
Two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
The pil@@ ot lines up the plane with the Hu@@ d@@ son Ri@@ ver .
That &apos;s usually not the route .
He turns off the eng@@ ines .
Now , imagine being in a plane with no sound .
And then he says three words .
The most un@@ emotional three words I &apos;ve ever heard .
He says , &quot; Br@@ ace for impact . &quot;
I didn &apos;t have to talk to the flight attend@@ ant anymore .
I could see in her eyes , it was ter@@ ror .
Life was over .
Now I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day .
I learned that it all changes in an instant .
We have this bu@@ cket list , we have these things we want to do in life , and I thought about all the people I wanted to reach out to that I didn &apos;t , all the f@@ ences I wanted to m@@ end , all the experiences I wanted to have and I never did .
As I thought about that later on , I came up with a saying , which is , &quot; I collect bad w@@ ines . &quot;
Because if the w@@ ine is ready and the person is there , I &apos;m opening it .
I no longer want to pos@@ t@@ po@@ ne anything in life .
And that ur@@ gency , that purpose , has really changed my life .
The second thing I learned that day -- and this is as we clear the George Washington Bri@@ dge , which was by not a lot -- I thought about , w@@ ow , I really feel one real regre@@ t .
I &apos;ve lived a good life .
In my own humanity and mis@@ takes , I &apos;ve tried to get better at everything I tried .
But in my humanity , I also allow my e@@ go to get in .
And I regre@@ t@@ ted the time I was@@ ted on things that did not matter with people that matter .
And I thought about my relationship with my wife , with my friends , with people .
And after , as I refl@@ ected on that , I decided to el@@ im@@ in@@ ate negative energy from my life .
It &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s a lot better .
I &apos;ve not had a fight with my wife in two years .
It feels great .
I no longer try to be right ; I choose to be happy .
The third thing I learned -- and this is as your mental clock starts going , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 . &quot;
You can see the water coming .
I &apos;m saying , &quot; Please b@@ low up . &quot;
I don &apos;t want this thing to break in 20 pieces like you &apos;ve seen in those document@@ aries .
And as we &apos;re coming down , I had a sense of , w@@ ow , dying is not scar@@ y .
It &apos;s almost like we &apos;ve been prepar@@ ing for it our whole lives .
But it was very sad .
I didn &apos;t want to go ; I love my life .
And that s@@ ad@@ ness really fr@@ amed in one thought , which is , I only wish for one thing .
I only wish I could see my kids grow up .
A@@ bout a month later , I was at a performance by my daughter -- fir@@ st-@@ grad@@ er , not much arti@@ stic talent -- Yet !
And I &apos;m b@@ aw@@ ling , I &apos;m cr@@ ying , like a little kid .
And it made all the sense in the world to me .
I realized at that point , by connec@@ ting those two dots , that the only thing that matters in my life is being a great dad .
A@@ bo@@ ve all , above all , the only goal I have in life is to be a good dad .
I was given the gi@@ ft of a miracle , of not dying that day .
I was given another gi@@ ft , which was to be able to see into the future and come back and live differently .
I challenge you guys that are flying today , imagine the same thing happens on your plane -- and please don &apos;t -- but imagine , and how would you change ?
What would you get done that you &apos;re waiting to get done because you think you &apos;ll be here forever ?
How would you change your relationships and the negative energy in them ?
And more than anything , are you being the best parent you can ?
Thank you .
I have had the distinc@@ t bl@@ essing in my life to have worked on a bunch of amazing projects .
But the co@@ ol@@ est I ever worked on was around this guy .
This guy &apos;s name is TE@@ M@@ P@@ T .
TE@@ M@@ P@@ T was one of the fore@@ most gr@@ aff@@ it@@ i artists in the 8@@ 0s .
And he came up home from a run one day and said , &quot; D@@ ad , my legs are t@@ ing@@ ling . &quot;
And that was the on@@ set of A@@ L@@ S .
So TE@@ M@@ P@@ T is now completely paraly@@ zed .
He only has use of his eyes .
I was ex@@ posed to him .
I have a company that does design and animation , so obviously gr@@ aff@@ it@@ i is definitely an in@@ tric@@ ate part of what we ad@@ mi@@ re and respect in the art world .
And so we decided that we were going to spon@@ s@@ or T@@ ony , TE@@ M@@ P@@ T , and his cause .
So I went and met with his brother and father and said , &quot; We &apos;re going to give you this money .
What are you going to do with it ? &quot;
And his brother said , &quot; I just want to be able to talk to T@@ ony again .
I just want to be able to communicate with him and him to be able to communicate with me . &quot;
And I said , &quot; W@@ ait a second , isn &apos;t that -- I &apos;ve seen Steph@@ en Haw@@ king -- don &apos;t all paraly@@ zed people have the ability to communicate via these devices ? &quot;
And he said , &quot; No , unless you &apos;re in the up@@ per ech@@ el@@ on and you &apos;ve got really amazing insur@@ ance , you can &apos;t actually do that .
These devices aren &apos;t accessible to people . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Well , how do you actually communicate ? &quot;
H@@ as everyone seen the movie &quot; The D@@ iv@@ ing B@@ ell and the Bu@@ t@@ ter@@ fly ? &quot;
That &apos;s how they communicate -- so run their finger along .
I said , &quot; That &apos;s arch@@ ai@@ c . How can that be ? &quot;
So I showed up with the desire to just write a check , and instead , I wrote a check that I had no fre@@ aking idea how I was going to cas@@ h .
I commit@@ ted to his brother and his father right then and there -- I &apos;m like , &quot; All right , here &apos;s the deal : T@@ ony &apos;s going to speak , we &apos;re going to get him a machine , and we &apos;re going to figure out a way for him to do his art again .
Because it &apos;s a trav@@ es@@ ty that someone who still has all of that in him isn &apos;t able to communicate it . &quot;
So I spoke at a conference a couple months after that .
I met these guys called G@@ R@@ L , G@@ ra@@ ff@@ it@@ i Res@@ ear@@ ch Lab , and they have a technology that allows them to project a light onto any surface and then , with a laser poin@@ ter , draw on it , and it just reg@@ is@@ ters the negative space .
So they go around and do art install@@ ations like this .
All the things that go up there , they said there &apos;s a life cycle .
First it starts with the sexual org@@ ans , then it starts with cus@@ s words , then it was Bush s@@ land@@ ers and then people actually got to art .
But there was always a life cycle to their pres@@ ent@@ ations .
So I went home and was having dinner with my wife and was telling her about this , and we were like , &quot; Well wait a second . If we know that this technology exists where you can use your eyes to control things , why don &apos;t we figure out a way for TE@@ M@@ P@@ T to control a laser and he could do gra@@ f again ? Well that would be awesome . &quot;
So that started the journey .
And about two years later , about a year later , after a bunch of organization and a bunch of moving things around , we &apos;d accompl@@ ished a couple things .
One , we batter@@ ed down the do@@ ors of the insur@@ ance companies , and we actually got TE@@ M@@ P@@ T a machine that let him communicate -- a Steph@@ en Haw@@ king machine .
Which was awesome .
And he &apos;s seriously one of the fun@@ ni@@ est -- I call him Y@@ od@@ a , because you talk to the guy , you get an email from him , and you &apos;re like , &quot; I &apos;m not wor@@ thy . This guy &apos;s so amazing . &quot;
The other thing we did is we fle@@ w seven programm@@ ers from all over the world -- literally every corner of the world -- into our house .
My wife and kids and I moved to our back gar@@ age , and these hackers and programm@@ ers and con@@ spir@@ acy the@@ or@@ ists and an@@ arch@@ ists took over our house .
A lot of our friends thought we were absolutely stupid to do that and that we were going to come back and all the pictures on the wall would be re@@ moved and gra@@ f on the walls .
But for over two weeks , we program@@ med , we went to the Ven@@ ice bo@@ ard@@ walk , my kids got involved , my dog got involved , and we created this .
This is called the E@@ y@@ e@@ W@@ r@@ iter , and you can see the descri@@ ption .
This is a cheap pair of sun@@ gl@@ asses that we bought at the Ven@@ ice B@@ each bo@@ ard@@ walk , some cop@@ per w@@ ire and some stuff from H@@ ome De@@ po@@ t and R@@ adi@@ o Sh@@ ack .
We took a P@@ S@@ 3 camera , h@@ acked it open , m@@ oun@@ ted it to an L@@ ED light , and now there &apos;s a device that is free -- you build this yourself , we publ@@ ish the code for free , you down@@ load the software for free .
And now we &apos;ve created a device that has absolutely no limit@@ ations .
There &apos;s no insur@@ ance company that can say &quot; No . &quot;
There &apos;s no hospital that can say &quot; No . &quot;
Any@@ body who &apos;s paraly@@ zed now has access to actually draw or communicate using only their eyes .
Thank you .
Thank you guys very much . That was awesome .
So at the end of the two weeks , we went back to TE@@ M@@ P@@ T &apos;s room .
I love this picture , because this is someone else &apos;s room and that &apos;s his room .
So there &apos;s all this hu@@ st@@ le and bu@@ st@@ le going on for the big un@@ ve@@ iling .
And after over a year of planning , two weeks of program@@ ming , T@@ ony drew again for the first time in seven years .
And this is an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and he &apos;s looking over his life support system .
We k@@ ic@@ ked his bed so that he could see out .
And we set up a proj@@ ect@@ or on a wall out in the parking lot outside of his hospital .
And he drew again for the first time , in front of his family and friends -- and you can only imagine what the feeling in the parking lot was .
The funny thing was , we had to break into the parking lot too , so we totally felt like we were leg@@ it in the whole gra@@ f scene too .
So at the end of this , he sent us an email , and this is what the email said : &quot; That was the first time I &apos;ve dra@@ wn anything for seven years .
I feel like I had been held underwater , and someone finally reach@@ ed down and pul@@ led my head up so I could brea@@ the . &quot;
Is@@ n &apos;t that awesome ?
So that &apos;s kind of our bat@@ tle cr@@ y .
That &apos;s what kee@@ ps us going and kee@@ ps us developing .
And we &apos;ve got such a long way to go with this .
This is an amazing device , but it &apos;s the equivalent of an E@@ t@@ ch A S@@ ket@@ ch .
And someone who has that kind of arti@@ stic potential des@@ er@@ ves so much more .
So we &apos;re in the process of trying to figure out how to make it better , faster , strong@@ er .
Since that time , we &apos;ve had all kinds of ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ gment .
We &apos;ve won a bunch of aw@@ ards .
Rem@@ ember , it &apos;s free ; none of us are making any money on this thing .
It &apos;s all coming out of our own po@@ ck@@ ets .
So the aw@@ ards were like , &quot; Oh , this is fantastic . &quot;
Ar@@ m@@ strong Twit@@ tered about us , and then in D@@ ec@@ ember , Ti@@ me magazine hon@@ o@@ red us as one of the top 50 inv@@ enti@@ ons of 2010 , which was really cool .
The co@@ ol@@ est thing about this -- and this is what &apos;s complet@@ ing the whole circle -- is that in A@@ pr@@ il of this year , at the G@@ eff@@ en M@@ O@@ CA in down@@ town Los Angeles , there &apos;s going to be an exhi@@ bi@@ tion called &quot; Art of the Stre@@ ets . &quot;
And &quot; Art of the Stre@@ ets &quot; is going to have pretty much the bad@@ -@@ asses of the street art scene -- B@@ ank@@ s@@ y , S@@ he@@ par@@ d Fai@@ re@@ y , K@@ A@@ W@@ S -- all of these guys will be there .
TE@@ M@@ P@@ T &apos;s going to be in the show , which is pretty awesome .
So basically this is my point : If you see something that &apos;s not possible , make it possible .
Everything in this room wasn &apos;t possible -- this stage , this computer , this mic , the E@@ y@@ e@@ W@@ r@@ iter -- wasn &apos;t possible at one point .
M@@ ake it possible , everyone in this room .
I &apos;m not a program@@ mer , never done anything with o@@ cul@@ ar recogni@@ tion technology , but I just recogni@@ zed something and associated myself with amazing people so that we could make something happen .
And this is the question I want everyone to ask yourself every single day when you come up with something you feel that needs to be done : if not now , then when ? And if not me , then who ?
Thank you guys .
I have spent the past few years putting myself into situations that are usually very difficult and at the same time some@@ what dangerous .
I went to prison -- difficult .
I worked in a coal mine -- dangerous .
I fil@@ med in war zones -- difficult and dangerous .
And I spent 30 days eating nothing but this -- fun in the beginning , little difficult in the middle , very dangerous in the end .
In fact , most of my career , I &apos;ve been immer@@ sing myself into seem@@ ingly horrible situations for the whole goal of trying to exam@@ ine soci@@ et@@ al issues in a way that make them engag@@ ing , that make them interesting , that hopefully break them down in a way that make them entert@@ aining and accessible to an audience .
So when I knew I was coming here to do a TED Talk that was going to look at the world of br@@ anding and spon@@ sor@@ ship , I knew I would want to do something a little different .
So as some of you may or may not have heard , a couple weeks ago , I took out an ad on e@@ Bay .
I sent out some Facebook messages , some Twitter messages , and I gave people the opportunity to buy the nam@@ ing rights to my 2011 TED Talk .
That &apos;s right , some lucky individual , corpor@@ ation , for@@ -@@ profit or non-@@ profit , was going to get the on@@ ce@@ -@@ in-@@ a-@@ lifetime opportunity -- because I &apos;m sure Chris Anderson will never let it happen again -- to buy the nam@@ ing rights to the talk you &apos;re watching right now , that at the time didn &apos;t have a ti@@ tle , didn &apos;t really have a lot of content and didn &apos;t really give much h@@ int
as to what the subject matter would actually be .
So what you were getting was this : Your name here pres@@ ents : My TED Talk that you have no idea what the subject is and , depend@@ ing on the content , could ultimately b@@ low up in your face , especially if I make you or your company look stupid for doing it .
But that being said , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
You know how many people watch these TED T@@ al@@ ks ?
It &apos;s a lot .
That &apos;s just a working ti@@ tle , by the way .
So even with that c@@ av@@ eat , I knew that someone would buy the nam@@ ing rights .
Now if you &apos;d have asked me that a year ago , I wouldn &apos;t have been able to tell you that with any certain@@ ty .
But in the new project that I &apos;m working on , my new film , we exam@@ ine the world of marketing , adver@@ tis@@ ing .
And as I said earlier , I put myself in some pretty horrible situations over the years , but nothing could pre@@ pare me , nothing could ready me , for anything as difficult or as dangerous as going into the rooms with these guys .
You see , I had this idea for a movie .
M@@ organ S@@ pur@@ lock : What I want to do is make a film all about product placement , marketing and adver@@ tis@@ ing , where the entire film is fun@@ ded by product placement , marketing and adver@@ tis@@ ing .
So the movie will be called &quot; The Gre@@ at@@ est Mo@@ vi@@ e E@@ ver S@@ old . &quot;
So what happens in &quot; The Gre@@ at@@ est Mo@@ vi@@ e E@@ ver S@@ old , &quot; is that everything from top to bottom , from start to finish , is br@@ and@@ ed from beginning to end -- from the abo@@ ve-@@ the@@ -@@ ti@@ tle spon@@ s@@ or that you &apos;ll see in the movie , which is brand X .
Now this brand , the Qu@@ al@@ com@@ m S@@ ta@@ di@@ um , the St@@ ap@@ les Center ...
these people will be married to the film in per@@ p@@ et@@ u@@ ity -- forever .
And so the film explor@@ es this whole idea -- It &apos;s what ? In per@@ p@@ et@@ u@@ ity , forever ?
I &apos;m a red@@ un@@ dant person . That was more for em@@ ph@@ as@@ is .
It was , &quot; In per@@ p@@ et@@ u@@ ity . F@@ ore@@ ver . &quot;
But not only are we going to have the brand X ti@@ tle spon@@ s@@ or , but we &apos;re going to make sure we sell out every categ@@ ory we can in the film .
So maybe we sell a sho@@ e and it becomes the greatest sho@@ e you ever w@@ ore ...
the greatest car you ever dro@@ ve from &quot; The Gre@@ at@@ est Mo@@ vi@@ e E@@ ver S@@ old , &quot; the greatest drink you &apos;ve ever had , cour@@ tes@@ y of &quot; The Gre@@ at@@ est Mo@@ vi@@ e E@@ ver S@@ old . &quot;
X@@ av@@ ier Ko@@ ch@@ h@@ ar : So the idea is , beyond just showing that bran@@ ds are a part of your life , but actually get them to finance the film ? MS : And actually we show the whole process of how does it work .
The goal of this whole film is transpar@@ ency .
You &apos;re going to see the whole thing take place in this movie .
So that &apos;s the whole concept , the whole film , start to finish .
And I would love for CE@@ G to help make it happen .
Robert Fri@@ ed@@ man : You know it &apos;s funny , because when I first hear it , it is the ul@@ timate respect for an audience .
Gu@@ y : I don &apos;t know how re@@ cep@@ tive people are going to be to it , though .
X@@ K : Do you have a perspective -- I don &apos;t want to use &quot; angle &quot; because that has a negative conn@@ ot@@ ation -- but do you know how this is going to play out ? David Co@@ h@@ n : How much money does it take to do this ?
MS : 1.@@ 5 million . John K@@ am@@ en : I think that you &apos;re going to have a hard time meeting with them , but I think it &apos;s certainly worth pur@@ su@@ ing a couple big , really obvious bran@@ ds .
X@@ K : Who knows , maybe by the time your film comes out , we look like a bunch of bli@@ ther@@ ing idi@@ ots .
MS : What do you think the response is going to be ?
Stu@@ art Ru@@ der@@ fer : The respon@@ ses mostly will be &quot; no . &quot;
MS : But is it a tough sell because of the film or a tough sell because of me ?
J@@ K : B@@ oth .
MS : ... Me@@ an@@ ing not so optimis@@ tic .
So , sir , can you help me ? I need help .
M@@ K : I can help you .
MS : Okay . A@@ w@@ esome .
M@@ K : We &apos;ve got@@ ta figure out which bran@@ ds .
MS : Yeah . When you look at the people you deal with .@@ .
M@@ K : We &apos;ve got some places we can go . Tur@@ n the camera off .
MS : I thought &quot; Tur@@ n the camera off &quot; meant , &quot; Let &apos;s have an off@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ record conversation . &quot;
Tur@@ ns out it really means , &quot; We want nothing to do with your movie . &quot;
MS : And just like that , one by one , all of these companies suddenly dis@@ appeared .
N@@ one of them wanted anything to do with this movie .
I was amaz@@ ed .
They wanted absolutely nothing to do with this project .
And I was blo@@ wn away , because I thought the whole concept , the idea of adver@@ tis@@ ing , was to get your product out in front of as many people as possible , to get as many people to see it as possible .
E@@ speci@@ ally in today &apos;s world , this inter@@ section of new media and old media and the fr@@ actu@@ red media landscape , isn &apos;t the idea to get that new bu@@ z@@ z@@ -@@ wor@@ thy deli@@ very vehicle that &apos;s going to get that message to the mas@@ ses ?
No , that &apos;s what I thought .
But the problem was , you see , my idea had one fat@@ al fl@@ a@@ w , and that fl@@ a@@ w was this .
Actually no , that was not the fl@@ a@@ w what@@ so@@ ever .
That wouldn &apos;t have been a problem at all .
This would have been fine .
But what this image represents was the problem .
See , when you do a Google image search for transpar@@ ency , this is -@@ -- This is one of the first images that comes up .
So I like the way you roll , S@@ erg@@ ey Br@@ in . No .
This is was the problem : transpar@@ ency -- free from pre@@ ten@@ se or dec@@ e@@ it ; easily det@@ ected or seen through ; read@@ ily understood ; character@@ ized by visi@@ bility or accessi@@ bility of information , especially concer@@ ning business practi@@ ces -- that last line being probably the biggest problem .
You see , we hear a lot about transpar@@ ency these days .
Our politicians say it , our president says it , even our CE@@ O &apos;s say it .
But suddenly when it comes down to becoming a reality , something suddenly changes .
But why ? Well , transpar@@ ency is scar@@ y -- like that od@@ d , s@@ till@@ -@@ scre@@ aming bear .
It &apos;s un@@ predic@@ table -- like this od@@ d country road .
And it &apos;s also very ris@@ ky .
What else is ris@@ ky ?
E@@ ating an entire bo@@ w@@ l of Co@@ ol Wh@@ i@@ p .
That &apos;s very ris@@ ky .
Now when I started talking to companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story , and they said , &quot; No , we want you to tell a story .
We want you to tell a story , but we just want to tell our story . &quot;
See , when I was a kid and my father would catch me in some sort of a lie -- and there he is giving me the look he often gave me -- he would say , &quot; Son , there &apos;s three sides to every story .
There &apos;s your story , there &apos;s my story and there &apos;s the real story . &quot;
Now you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the real story .
But with only one company , one ag@@ ency willing to help me -- and that &apos;s only because I knew John B@@ ond and Richard K@@ ir@@ sh@@ en@@ b@@ au@@ m for years -- I realized that I would have to go on my own , I &apos;d have to cut out the midd@@ lem@@ an and go to the companies myself with all of my team .
So what you suddenly started to realize -- or what I started to realize -- is that when you started having conversations with these companies , the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem .
MS : I have friends who make great big , giant Hollywood films , and I have friends who make little independent films like I make .
And the friends of mine who make big , giant Hollywood movies say the reason their films are so successful is because of the brand part@@ ners that they have .
And then my friends who make small independent films say , &quot; Well , how are we supposed to com@@ pe@@ te with these big , giant Hollywood movies ? &quot;
And the movie is called &quot; The Gre@@ at@@ est Mo@@ vi@@ e E@@ ver S@@ old . &quot;
So how specifically will we see B@@ an in the film ?
An@@ y time I &apos;m ready to go , any time I open up my medicine cab@@ in@@ et , you will see B@@ an de@@ od@@ or@@ ant .
While any@@ time I do an interview with someone , I can say , &quot; Are you fresh enough for this interview ?
Are you ready ? You look a little nervous .
I want to help you cal@@ m down .
So maybe you should put some one before the interview . &quot;
So we &apos;ll offer one of these fabul@@ ous sc@@ ents .
Wh@@ e@@ ther it &apos;s a &quot; Fl@@ oral F@@ u@@ sion &quot; or a &quot; Par@@ a@@ dise W@@ in@@ ds , &quot; they &apos;ll have their chance .
We will have them g@@ ear@@ ed for both male or female -- soli@@ d , ro@@ ll@@ -@@ on or stick , whatever it may be .
That &apos;s the two-@@ cent tour .
So now I can answer any of your questions and give you the fi@@ ve-@@ cent tour .
K@@ aren Frank : We are a smaller brand .
Mu@@ ch like you talked about being a smaller movie , we &apos;re very much a challeng@@ er brand .
So we don &apos;t have the bud@@ gets that other bran@@ ds have .
So doing things like this -- you know , re@@ mind people about B@@ an -- is kind of why were interested in it .
MS : What are the words that you would use to describe B@@ an ?
B@@ an is bl@@ ank .
K@@ F : That &apos;s a great question .
Wom@@ an : Su@@ peri@@ or technology .
MS : T@@ echno@@ logy &apos;s not the way you want to describe something somebody &apos;s putting in their ar@@ mp@@ it .
Man : We talk about b@@ old , fresh .
I think &quot; fresh &quot; is a great word that really sp@@ ins this categ@@ ory into the positive , versus &quot; fi@@ ghts od@@ or and w@@ et@@ ness . &quot;
It kee@@ ps you fresh .
How do we keep you fres@@ her longer -- better fres@@ h@@ ness , more fres@@ h@@ ness , three times fres@@ her .
Th@@ ings like that that are more of that positive benefit .
MS : And that &apos;s a multi-@@ million dollar corpor@@ ation .
What about me ? What about a regular guy ?
I need to go talk to the man on the street , the people who are like me , the regular Jo@@ es .
They need to tell me about my brand .
MS : How would you guys describe your brand ?
Man : U@@ m , my brand ?
I don &apos;t know .
I like really nice clo@@ thes .
Wom@@ an : 80 &apos;s re@@ viv@@ al me@@ ets sk@@ at@@ er-@@ pun@@ k , unless it &apos;s laun@@ dry day .
MS : All right , what is brand Ger@@ ry ?
Ger@@ ry : Uni@@ que . Man : I guess what kind of gen@@ re , style I am would be like dark g@@ la@@ mor .
I like a lot of black colors , a lot of gr@@ ays and stuff like that .
But usually I have an acc@@ ess@@ ory , like sun@@ gl@@ asses , or I like cry@@ st@@ al and things like that too .
Wom@@ an : If Dan were a brand , he might be a classi@@ c conver@@ tible Mer@@ ce@@ des Ben@@ z .
Man 2 : The brand that I am is , I would call it ca@@ su@@ al fly .
Wom@@ an 2 : Par@@ t hi@@ p@@ pie , part y@@ o@@ g@@ i , part Bro@@ ok@@ ly@@ n girl -- I don &apos;t know .
Man 3 : I &apos;m the p@@ et guy .
I sell p@@ et to@@ ys all over the country , all over the world .
So I guess that &apos;s my brand .
In my war@@ ped little industry , that &apos;s my brand .
Man 4 : My brand is F@@ ed@@ E@@ x because I deliver the go@@ ods .
Man 5 : F@@ ailed writ@@ er-@@ al@@ co@@ ho@@ lic brand .
Is that something ?
L@@ aw@@ yer : I &apos;m a law@@ yer brand .
Tom : I &apos;m Tom .
MS : Well we can &apos;t all be brand Tom , but I do often find myself at the inter@@ section of dark g@@ la@@ mor and ca@@ su@@ al fly .
And what I realized is I needed an expert .
I needed somebody who could get inside my head , somebody who could really help me understand what they call your &quot; brand person@@ ality . &quot;
And so I found a company called O@@ l@@ son Z@@ al@@ t@@ man in P@@ it@@ t@@ s@@ bur@@ g .
They &apos;ve helped companies like N@@ es@@ tle , Fe@@ bre@@ ze , H@@ all@@ mark discover that brand person@@ ality .
If they could do it for them , su@@ rely they could do it for me .
A@@ bi@@ g@@ ail : You brought your pictures , right ?
MS : I did . The very first picture is a picture of my family .
A : So tell me a little bit how it rel@@ ates to your thoughts and feelings about who you are .
MS : These are the people who shape the way I look at the world .
A : T@@ ell me about this world .
MS : This world ? I think your world is the world that you live in -- like people who are around you , your friends , your family , the way you live your life , the job you do .
All those things st@@ em@@ med and started from one place , and for me they st@@ em@@ med and started with my family in West Vir@@ gin@@ ia .
A : What &apos;s the next one you want to talk about ?
MS : The next one : This was the best day ever .
A : How does this rel@@ ate to your thoughts and feelings about who you are ?
MS : It &apos;s like , who do I want to be ?
I like things that are different .
I like things that are weird . I like weird things .
A : T@@ ell me about the &quot; why &quot; phase -- what does that do for us ?
What is the mach@@ e@@ te ? What pu@@ p@@ a stage are you in now ?
Why is it important to re@@ bo@@ ot ? What does the red represent ?
T@@ ell me a little bit about that part .
... A little more about you that is not who you are .
What are some other met@@ am@@ or@@ pho@@ ses that you &apos;ve had ?
... Do@@ esn &apos;t have to be fear . What kind of rol@@ ler co@@ aster are you on ?
MS : E@@ E@@ E@@ E@@ E@@ E ! No , thank you .
A : Thanks for you pati@@ ence . A : Yeah . All right .
MS : Yeah , I don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to come of this .
There was a whole lot of crazy going on in there .
L@@ ind@@ say Z@@ al@@ t@@ man : The first thing we saw was this idea that you had two distinc@@ t , but compl@@ ement@@ ary sides to your brand person@@ ality -- the M@@ organ S@@ pur@@ lock brand is a min@@ d@@ ful / play brand .
Those are ju@@ x@@ ta@@ posed very nic@@ ely together .
And I think there &apos;s almost a parado@@ x with those .
And I think some companies will just focus on one of their str@@ eng@@ ths or the other instead of foc@@ using on both .
Most companies tend to -- and it &apos;s human nature -- to avoid things that they &apos;re not sure of , avoid fear , those elements , and you really embr@@ ace those , and you actually turn them into posi@@ tives for you , and it &apos;s a ne@@ at thing to see .
What other bran@@ ds are like that ?
The first on here is the classi@@ c , Apple .
And you can see here too , T@@ ar@@ get , Wi@@ i , Min@@ i from the Min@@ i Co@@ op@@ ers , and J@@ et@@ B@@ lue .
Now there &apos;s play@@ ful bran@@ ds and min@@ d@@ ful bran@@ ds , those things that have come and gone , but a play@@ ful , min@@ d@@ ful brand is a pretty powerful thing .
MS : A play@@ ful , min@@ d@@ ful brand . What is your brand ?
If somebody asked you to describe your brand identity , your brand person@@ ality , what would you be ?
Are you an up attribu@@ te ? Are you something that gets the blood flo@@ wing ?
Or are you more of a down attribu@@ te ?
Are you something that &apos;s a little more cal@@ m , res@@ er@@ ved , conserv@@ ative ?
U@@ p attribu@@ tes are things like being play@@ ful , being fresh like the F@@ res@@ h Pr@@ ince , contempor@@ ary , ad@@ ven@@ tur@@ ous , ed@@ g@@ y or dar@@ ing like E@@ r@@ ro@@ l F@@ ly@@ n@@ n , n@@ im@@ ble or ag@@ ile , prof@@ ane , dom@@ ine@@ ering , mag@@ ical or my@@ s@@ tical like G@@ and@@ al@@ f .
Or are you more of a down attribu@@ te ?
Are you min@@ d@@ ful , sophistic@@ ated like 00@@ 7 ?
Are you establ@@ ished , traditional , nur@@ tur@@ ing , prot@@ ective , emp@@ a@@ thetic like the O@@ pr@@ ah ?
Are you reli@@ able , stable , familiar , safe , sec@@ ure , sac@@ red , cont@@ empl@@ ative or wise like the D@@ al@@ ai L@@ ama or Y@@ od@@ a ?
Over the course of this film , we had 5@@ 0@@ 0-@@ plus companies who were up and down companies saying , &quot; no , &quot; they didn &apos;t want any part of this project .
They wanted nothing to do with this film , main@@ ly because they would have no control , they would have no control over the final product .
But we did get 17 brand part@@ ners who were willing to rel@@ in@@ qu@@ ish that control , who wanted to be in business with someone as min@@ d@@ ful and as play@@ ful as myself and who ultimately em@@ powered us to tell stories that normally we wouldn &apos;t be able to tell -- stories that an adver@@ tis@@ er would normally never get behind .
They en@@ ab@@ led us to tell the story about neu@@ rom@@ ar@@ k@@ eting , as we got into telling the story in this film about how now they &apos;re using M@@ R@@ I &apos;s to target the desire centers of your brain for both commerci@@ als as well as movie marketing .
We went to San Pau@@ lo where they have b@@ ann@@ ed out@@ door adver@@ tis@@ ing .
In the entire city for the past five years , there &apos;s no bill@@ bo@@ ards , there &apos;s no pos@@ ters , there &apos;s no fl@@ yers , nothing .
And we went to school dis@@ tric@@ ts where now companies are making their way into cas@@ h@@ -@@ str@@ apped schools all across America .
What &apos;s incredible for me is the projects that I &apos;ve gotten the most feedback out of , or I &apos;ve had the most success in , are ones where I &apos;ve inter@@ acted with things directly .
And that &apos;s what these bran@@ ds did .
They cut out the midd@@ lem@@ an , they cut out their ag@@ encies and said , &quot; Maybe these ag@@ encies don &apos;t have my best interest in mind .
I &apos;m going to deal directly with the artist .
I &apos;m going to work with him to create something different , something that &apos;s going to get people thinking , that &apos;s going to challenge the way we look at the world . &quot;
And how has that been for them ? H@@ as it been successful ?
Well , since the film premi@@ ered at the S@@ un@@ dance F@@ il@@ m F@@ es@@ tiv@@ al , let &apos;s take a look .
Ac@@ cor@@ ding to Bur@@ rel@@ les , the movie premi@@ ered in Jan@@ u@@ ary , and since then -- and this isn &apos;t even the whole thing -- we &apos;ve had 9@@ 00 million media impres@@ sions for this film .
That &apos;s literally co@@ vering just like a two and a hal@@ f-@@ week period .
That &apos;s only online -- no print , no TV .
The film hasn &apos;t even been distribu@@ ted yet .
It &apos;s not even online . It &apos;s not even stre@@ aming .
It &apos;s not even been out into other foreign countries yet .
So ultimately , this film has already started to gain a lot of mom@@ en@@ tum .
And not bad for a project that almost every ad ag@@ ency we talked to ad@@ vis@@ ed their clients not to take part .
What I always believe is that if you take chances , if you take risks , that in those risks will come opportunity .
I believe that when you push people away from that , you &apos;re push@@ ing them more towards failure .
I believe that when you train your employ@@ ees to be risk aver@@ se , then you &apos;re prepar@@ ing your whole company to be re@@ ward challeng@@ ed .
I feel like that what has to happen moving forward is we need to encourage people to take risks .
We need to encourage people to not be afraid of opportunities that may sc@@ are them .
U@@ l@@ timately , moving forward , I think we have to embr@@ ace fear .
We &apos;ve got to put that bear in a c@@ age .
Em@@ br@@ ace fear . Em@@ br@@ ace risk .
One big spo@@ on@@ ful at a time , we have to embr@@ ace risk .
And ultimately , we have to embr@@ ace transpar@@ ency .
Today , more than ever , a little hon@@ es@@ ty is going to go a long way .
And that being said , through hon@@ es@@ ty and transpar@@ ency , my entire talk , &quot; Em@@ br@@ ace Trans@@ par@@ ency , &quot; has been brought to you by my good friends at E@@ M@@ C , who for $ 7@@ ,@@ 100 bought the nam@@ ing rights on e@@ Bay .
E@@ M@@ C : Tur@@ ning big data into big opportunity for organizations all over the world .
E@@ M@@ C pres@@ ents : &quot; Em@@ br@@ ace Trans@@ par@@ ency . &quot;
Thank you very much , guys .
J@@ une Co@@ h@@ en : So , M@@ organ , in the name of transpar@@ ency , what exactly happened to that $ 7@@ ,@@ 100 ?
MS : That is a fantastic question .
I have in my po@@ cket a check made out to the parent organization to the TED organization , the Sa@@ pl@@ ing F@@ oundation -- a check for $ 7@@ ,@@ 100 to be appli@@ ed toward my attend@@ ance for next year &apos;s TED .
The idea behind the Stu@@ x@@ net computer wor@@ m is actually quite simple .
We don &apos;t want Iran to get the bom@@ b .
Their major ass@@ et for developing nuclear weapons is the N@@ at@@ an@@ z ur@@ ani@@ um en@@ rich@@ ment facil@@ ity .
The gr@@ ay box@@ es that you see , these are re@@ al-@@ time control systems .
Now if we manage to com@@ promise these systems that control drive spe@@ eds and val@@ ves , we can actually cause a lot of problems with the cen@@ tri@@ fu@@ ge .
The gr@@ ay box@@ es don &apos;t run W@@ in@@ do@@ ws software ; they are a completely different technology .
But if we manage to place a good W@@ in@@ do@@ ws virus on a not@@ e@@ book that is used by a main@@ ten@@ ance engineer to con@@ figure this gr@@ ay box , then we are in business .
And this is the pl@@ ot behind Stu@@ x@@ net .
So we start with a W@@ in@@ do@@ ws dro@@ p@@ per .
The pay@@ load goes onto the gr@@ ay box , dam@@ ages the cen@@ tri@@ fu@@ ge , and the I@@ ran@@ ian nuclear program is del@@ ayed -- mission accompl@@ ished .
That &apos;s easy , hu@@ h ?
I want to tell you how we found that out .
When we started our research on Stu@@ x@@ net six months ago , it was completely un@@ known what the purpose of this thing was .
The only thing that was known is it &apos;s very , very complex on the W@@ in@@ do@@ ws part , the dro@@ p@@ per part , used multiple zer@@ o-@@ day vulner@@ abilities .
And it seemed to want to do something with these gr@@ ay box@@ es , these re@@ al-@@ time control systems .
So that got our attention , and we started a lab project where we inf@@ ected our environment with Stu@@ x@@ net and chec@@ ked this thing out .
And then some very funny things happened .
Stu@@ x@@ net behav@@ ed like a lab rat that didn &apos;t like our che@@ ese -- s@@ ni@@ ff@@ ed , but didn &apos;t want to eat .
D@@ id@@ n &apos;t make sense to me .
And after we experim@@ ented with different fl@@ av@@ ors of che@@ ese , I realized , well , this is a direc@@ ted attack .
It &apos;s completely direc@@ ted .
The dro@@ p@@ per is pro@@ w@@ ling activ@@ ely on the gr@@ ay box if a specific con@@ figur@@ ation is found , and even if the actual program code that it &apos;s trying to inf@@ ect is actually running on that target .
And if not , Stu@@ x@@ net does nothing .
So that really got my attention , and we started to work on this nearly around the clock , because I thought , &quot; Well , we don &apos;t know what the target is .
It could be , let &apos;s say for example , a U.S. power plant , or a chemical plant in Germany .
So we better find out what the target is soon . &quot;
So we extr@@ acted and de@@ comp@@ il@@ ed the attack code , and we discovered that it &apos;s struc@@ tured in two digital bomb@@ s -- a smaller one and a bigger one .
And we also saw that they are very professi@@ on@@ ally engine@@ ered by people who obviously had all insi@@ der information .
They knew all the bits and b@@ ites that they had to attack .
They probably even know the sho@@ e size of the oper@@ ator .
So they know everything .
And if you have heard that the dro@@ p@@ per of Stu@@ x@@ net is complex and high-@@ tech , let me tell you this : the pay@@ load is ro@@ cket science .
It &apos;s way above everything that we have ever seen before .
Here you see a sam@@ ple of this actual attack code .
We are talking about -- around about 15@@ ,000 lines of code .
L@@ oo@@ ks pretty much like ol@@ d-@@ style ass@@ em@@ bly language .
And I want to tell you how we were able to make sense out of this code .
So what we were looking for is , first of all , system function calls , because we know what they do .
And then we were looking for tim@@ ers and data structures and trying to rel@@ ate them to the real world -- to potential real world tar@@ gets .
So we do need target the@@ ories that we can prove or dis@@ prove .
In order to get target the@@ ories , we remember that it &apos;s definitely hard@@ core s@@ ab@@ ot@@ age , it must be a high-@@ value target and it is most likely loc@@ ated in Iran , because that &apos;s where most of the inf@@ ections had been re@@ ported .
Now you don &apos;t find several thousand tar@@ gets in that area .
It basically bo@@ ils down to the B@@ us@@ he@@ h@@ r nuclear power plant and to the N@@ at@@ an@@ z fuel en@@ rich@@ ment plant .
So I told my ass@@ istant , &quot; G@@ et me a list of all cen@@ tri@@ fu@@ ge and power plant experts from our client base . &quot;
And I ph@@ oned them up and picked their brain in an effort to match their exper@@ tise with what we found in code and data .
And that worked pretty well .
So we were able to associ@@ ate the small digital war@@ head with the rot@@ or control .
The rot@@ or is that moving part within the cen@@ tri@@ fu@@ ge , that black object that you see .
And if you manipul@@ ate the speed of this rot@@ or , you are actually able to cr@@ ack the rot@@ or and eventually even have the cen@@ tri@@ fu@@ ge explo@@ de .
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was really to do it slowly and cre@@ ep@@ y -- obviously in an effort to drive main@@ ten@@ ance engineers crazy , that they would not be able to figure this out quickly .
The big digital war@@ head -- we had a shot at this by looking very clo@@ sely at data and data structures .
So for example , the number 16@@ 4 really st@@ ands out in that code ; you can &apos;t over@@ look it .
I started to research scientific liter@@ ature on how these cen@@ tri@@ fu@@ ges are actually built in N@@ at@@ an@@ z and found they are struc@@ tured in what is called a cas@@ c@@ ade , and each cas@@ c@@ ade hol@@ ds 16@@ 4 cen@@ tri@@ fu@@ ges .
So that made sense , that was a match .
And it even got better .
These cen@@ tri@@ fu@@ ges in Iran are sub@@ divi@@ ded into 15 , what is called , st@@ ages .
And guess what we found in the attack code ?
An almost identi@@ cal structure .
So again , that was a real good match .
And this gave us very high confidence for what we were looking at .
Now don &apos;t get me wrong here , it didn &apos;t go like this .
These results have been ob@@ t@@ ained over several weeks of really hard labor .
And we often went into just a dead end and had to re@@ cover .
Any@@ way , so we figured out that both digital war@@ heads were actually aim@@ ing at one and the same target , but from different angles .
The small war@@ head is taking one cas@@ c@@ ade , and sp@@ inning up the rot@@ ors and s@@ lowing them down , and the big war@@ head is talking to six cas@@ c@@ ades and manipul@@ ating val@@ ves .
So in all , we are very confi@@ dent that we have actually determin@@ ed what the target is .
It is N@@ at@@ an@@ z , and it is only N@@ at@@ an@@ z .
So we don &apos;t have to worry that other tar@@ gets might be hit by Stu@@ x@@ net .
Here &apos;s some very cool stuff that we saw -- really kno@@ c@@ ked my so@@ cks off .
D@@ own there is the gr@@ ay box , and on the top you see the cen@@ tri@@ fu@@ ges .
Now what this thing does is it inter@@ cep@@ ts the in@@ put values from sens@@ ors -- so for example , from pressure sens@@ ors and vibr@@ ation sens@@ ors -- and it provi@@ des le@@ gi@@ timate program code , which is still running during the attack , with fa@@ ke in@@ put data .
And as a matter of fact , this fa@@ ke in@@ put data is actually pr@@ er@@ ec@@ or@@ ded by Stu@@ x@@ net .
So it &apos;s just like from the Hollywood movies where during the he@@ ist , the observation camera is f@@ ed with pr@@ er@@ ec@@ or@@ ded video .
That &apos;s cool , hu@@ h ?
The idea here is obviously not only to fo@@ ol the oper@@ ators in the control room .
It actually is much more dangerous and ag@@ gr@@ essive .
The idea is to circum@@ vent a digital safety system .
We need digital safety systems where a human oper@@ ator could not act quick enough .
So for example , in a power plant , when your big stea@@ m turb@@ ine gets too over speed , you must open reli@@ ef val@@ ves within a mill@@ is@@ ec@@ ond .
Ob@@ vi@@ ously , this cannot be done by a human oper@@ ator .
So this is where we need digital safety systems .
And when they are com@@ prom@@ is@@ ed , then real bad things can happen .
Your plant can b@@ low up .
And ne@@ ither your oper@@ ators nor your safety system will notice it .
That &apos;s scar@@ y .
But it gets worse .
And this is very important , what I &apos;m going to say .
Think about this : this attack is gener@@ ic .
It doesn &apos;t have anything to do , in speci@@ fic@@ s , with cen@@ tri@@ fu@@ ges , with ur@@ ani@@ um en@@ rich@@ ment .
So it would work as well , for example , in a power plant or in an automobile factory .
It is gener@@ ic .
And you don &apos;t have -- as an att@@ ack@@ er -- you don &apos;t have to deliver this pay@@ load by a U@@ S@@ B stick , as we saw it in the case of Stu@@ x@@ net .
You could also use conventi@@ onal wor@@ m technology for sp@@ reading .
Just spread it as wide as possible .
And if you do that , what you end up with is a cy@@ ber wea@@ pon of mass destruction .
That &apos;s the conse@@ quence that we have to face .
So unfortunately , the biggest number of tar@@ gets for such attacks are not in the Middle East .
They &apos;re in the United States and Europe and in Japan .
So all of the green areas , these are your t@@ arg@@ et@@ -@@ rich environments .
We have to face the consequences , and we better start to pre@@ pare right now .
Thanks .
Chris Anderson : I &apos;ve got a question .
R@@ al@@ p@@ h , it &apos;s been quite wid@@ ely re@@ ported that people assu@@ me that Mo@@ ss@@ ad is the main enti@@ ty behind this .
Is that your opinion ?
R@@ al@@ p@@ h L@@ ang@@ ner : Okay , you really want to hear that ?
Yeah . Okay .
My opinion is that the Mo@@ ss@@ ad is involved , but that the leading force is not Israel .
So the leading force behind that is the cy@@ ber super@@ power .
There is only one , and that &apos;s the United States -- fortunately , fortunately .
Because otherwise , our problems would even be bigger .
CA : Thank you for scar@@ ing the living d@@ ay@@ lights out of us . Thank you , R@@ al@@ p@@ h .
I want you now to imagine a w@@ ear@@ able robot that gives you super@@ human abilities , or another one that takes whe@@ el@@ chair users up standing and walking again .
We at Ber@@ k@@ el@@ ey Bi@@ on@@ ics call these robots ex@@ os@@ k@@ el@@ et@@ ons .
These are nothing else than something that you put on in the morning , and it will give you extra strength , and it will further en@@ h@@ ance your speed , and it will help you , for instance , to manage your balance .
It is actually the true integr@@ ation of the man and the machine .
But not only that -- it will integr@@ ate and network you to the universe and other devices out there .
This is just not some blue sky thinking .
To show you now what we are working on by starting out talking about the American soldi@@ er , that on average does carry about 100 l@@ b@@ s@@ . on their b@@ acks , and they are being asked to carry more equipment .
Ob@@ vi@@ ously , this is resul@@ ting in some major complic@@ ations -- back in@@ ju@@ ries , 30 percent of them -- chron@@ ic back in@@ ju@@ ries .
So we thought we would look at this challenge and create an ex@@ os@@ k@@ el@@ eton that would help deal with this issue .
So let me now introduce to you H@@ U@@ L@@ C -- or the Hu@@ man Uni@@ vers@@ al Lo@@ ad C@@ arri@@ er .
Sol@@ di@@ er : With the H@@ U@@ L@@ C ex@@ os@@ k@@ el@@ eton , I can carry 200 l@@ b@@ s@@ . over vari@@ ed terrain for many hours .
I@@ ts flex@@ ible design allows for deep squ@@ ats , cr@@ aw@@ ls and high-@@ ag@@ il@@ ity movements .
It sen@@ ses what I want to do , where I want to go , and then aug@@ ments my strength and end@@ ur@@ ance .
E@@ y@@ th@@ or B@@ ender : We are ready with our industry partner to introduce this device , this new ex@@ os@@ k@@ el@@ eton this year .
So this is for real .
Now let &apos;s turn our heads towards the whe@@ el@@ chair users , something that I &apos;m particularly passionate about .
There are 6@@ 8 million people estim@@ ated to be in whe@@ el@@ ch@@ airs worldwide .
This is about one percent of the total population .
And that &apos;s actually a conserv@@ ative estim@@ ate .
We are talking here about , of@@ ten@@ times , very young individuals with sp@@ inal cord in@@ ju@@ ries , that in the prime of their life -- 20@@ s , 3@@ 0s , 4@@ 0s -- hit a wall and the whe@@ el@@ chair &apos;s the only option .
But it is also the aging population that is multi@@ pl@@ ying in numbers .
And the only option , pretty much -- when it &apos;s str@@ oke or other complic@@ ations -- is the whe@@ el@@ chair .
And that is actually for the last 500 years , since its very successful intro@@ duction , I must say .
So we thought we would start writing a brand new chap@@ ter of mo@@ bility .
Let me now introduce you to e@@ L@@ E@@ G@@ S that is wor@@ n by A@@ man@@ da Bo@@ x@@ tel that 19 years ago was sp@@ inal cord in@@ ju@@ red , and as a result of that she has not been able to walk for 19 years until now .
A@@ man@@ da Bo@@ x@@ tel : Thank you .
E@@ B : A@@ man@@ da is wearing our e@@ L@@ E@@ G@@ S set .
It has sens@@ ors .
It &apos;s completely non-@@ invas@@ ive , sens@@ ors in the cru@@ t@@ ches that send signals back to our on@@ board computer that is sitting here at her back .
There are battery p@@ acks here as well that power mot@@ ors that are sitting at her hi@@ ps , as well as her k@@ ne@@ e jo@@ ints , that move her forward in this kind of smo@@ oth and very natural g@@ ait .
A@@ B : I was 24 years old and at the top of my game when a fre@@ ak sum@@ mer@@ sau@@ lt while down@@ h@@ ill ski@@ ing paraly@@ zed me .
In a sp@@ lit second , I lost all sensation and movement below my pel@@ vis .
Not long after@@ wards , a doctor str@@ ode into my hospital room , and he said , &quot; A@@ man@@ da , you &apos;ll never walk again . &quot;
And that was 19 y@@ e@@ as ago .
He rob@@ bed every oun@@ ce of hope from my being .
Ad@@ ap@@ tive technology has since en@@ ab@@ led me to learn how to down@@ h@@ ill sk@@ i again , to rock clim@@ b and even hand@@ cycle .
But nothing has been invented that en@@ ables me to walk , until now .
Thank you .
E@@ B : As you can see , we have the technology , we have the plat@@ forms to sit down and have discus@@ sions with you .
It &apos;s in our hands , and we have all the potential here to change the lives of future generations -- not only for the soldiers , or for A@@ man@@ da here and all the whe@@ el@@ chair users , but for everyone .
A@@ B : Thanks .
I just came back from a community that hol@@ ds the secret to human survival .
It &apos;s a place where women run the show , have sex to say hel@@ lo , and play rules the day -- where fun is serious business .
And no , this isn &apos;t Bur@@ ning Man or San Francisco .
L@@ adi@@ es and gentlemen , meet your cous@@ ins .
This is the world of wild bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s in the jun@@ gles of Congo .
Bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s are , together with chimpanz@@ ees , your living clo@@ s@@ est relative .
That means we all share a common ancest@@ or , an evolutionary grandmother , who lived around six million years ago .
Now , chimpanz@@ ees are well-@@ known for their ag@@ gr@@ ession .
But unfortunately , we have made too much of an em@@ ph@@ as@@ is of this aspect in our narr@@ atives of human evolution .
But bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s show us the other side of the coin .
While chimpanz@@ ees are domin@@ ated by big , scar@@ y guys , bon@@ ob@@ o society is run by em@@ powered fem@@ ales .
These guys have really worked something out , since this leads to a highly tol@@ er@@ ant society where fat@@ al violence has not been obser@@ ved yet .
But unfortunately , bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s are the least understood of the great apes .
They live in the de@@ p@@ ths of the C@@ ong@@ ol@@ ese jun@@ gle , and it has been very difficult to study them .
The Congo is a parado@@ x -- a land of extraordinary bio@@ diversity and beauty , but also the heart of dark@@ ness itself -- the scene of a violent conflict that has r@@ aged for decades and cl@@ aim@@ ed nearly as many lives as the First World War .
Not surpris@@ ingly , this destruction also end@@ angers bon@@ ob@@ o survival .
B@@ ush@@ meat tra@@ des and forest loss means we couldn &apos;t fill a small st@@ adi@@ um with all the bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s that are left in the world -- and we &apos;re not even sure of that to be honest .
Yet , in this land of violence and chaos , you can hear hidden lau@@ ghter sw@@ aying the trees .
Who are these cous@@ ins ?
We know them as the &quot; make love , not war &quot; apes since they have fre@@ quent , prom@@ is@@ cu@@ ous and b@@ is@@ exu@@ al sex to manage conflict and solve social issues .
Now , I &apos;m not saying this is the solution to all of humanity &apos;s problems -- since there &apos;s more to bon@@ ob@@ o life than the K@@ ama Su@@ tra .
Bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s , like humans , love to play throughout their entire lives .
Pl@@ ay is not just child &apos;s games .
For us and them , play is f@@ ound@@ ational for bon@@ ding relationships and fo@@ st@@ ering tol@@ er@@ ance .
It &apos;s where we learn to trust and where we learn about the rules of the game .
Pl@@ ay increas@@ es creativity and res@@ ili@@ ence , and it &apos;s all about the generation of diversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity of behavi@@ ors , diversity of connections .
And when you watch bon@@ ob@@ o play , you &apos;re seeing the very evolutionary ro@@ ots of human lau@@ ghter , dance and ritu@@ al .
Pl@@ ay is the g@@ lue that bin@@ ds us together .
Now , I don &apos;t know how you play , but I want to show you a couple of unique cli@@ ps fresh from the wild .
First , it &apos;s a ball game bon@@ o@@ bo@@ -@@ style -- and I do not mean football .
So here , we have a young female and a male engaged in a cha@@ se game .
Have a look what she &apos;s doing .
It might be the evolutionary orig@@ in of the phrase , &quot; she &apos;s got him by the b@@ alls . &quot;
On@@ ly I think that he &apos;s rather lo@@ ving it here , right ?
Yeah .
So sex play is common in both bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s and humans .
And this video is really interesting because it shows -- this video &apos;s really interesting because it shows the inv@@ enti@@ ven@@ ess of bringing unusual elements into play -- such as tes@@ tic@@ les -- and also how play both requires trust and fo@@ sters trust -- while at the same time being tremendous fun .
But play &apos;s a shap@@ es@@ hi@@ f@@ ter .
Pl@@ ay &apos;s a shap@@ es@@ hi@@ f@@ ter , and it can take many forms , some of which are more qui@@ et , imagin@@ ative , curious -- maybe where wonder is discovered an@@ ew .
And I want you to see , this is F@@ u@@ k@@ u , a young female , and she is qui@@ et@@ ly playing with water .
I think , like her , we sometimes play alone , and we explore the boun@@ dar@@ ies of our inner and our ou@@ ter worlds .
And it &apos;s that play@@ ful curios@@ ity that drives us to explore , drives us to interact , and then the un@@ expected connections we form are the real hot@@ bed for creativity .
So these are just small tas@@ ters into the insi@@ ghts that bon@@ ob@@ o give us to our past and present .
But they also hold a secret for our future , a future where we need to adap@@ t to an increasingly challeng@@ ing world through greater creativity and greater co@@ operation .
The secret is that play is the key to these capac@@ i@@ ties .
In other words , play is our adap@@ tive wil@@ d@@ card .
In order to adap@@ t success@@ fully to a changing world , we need to play .
But will we make the most of our play@@ ful@@ ness ?
Pl@@ ay is not fri@@ vol@@ ous .
Pl@@ ay &apos;s essential .
For bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s and humans ali@@ ke , life is not just red in to@@ oth and cl@@ a@@ w .
In times when it seems least appropri@@ ate to play , it might be the times when it is most ur@@ gent .
And so , my fellow prim@@ ates , let us embr@@ ace this gi@@ ft from evolution and play together , as we re@@ discover creativity , fel@@ low@@ ship and wonder .
Thank you .
B@@ ack in New York , I am the head of development for a non-@@ profit called Rob@@ in H@@ ood .
When I &apos;m not fighting poverty , I &apos;m fighting fi@@ res as the ass@@ istant cap@@ t@@ ain of a volunte@@ er fire company .
Now in our town , where the volunte@@ ers sup@@ pl@@ ement a highly sk@@ illed career staf@@ f , you have to get to the fire scene pretty early to get in on any action .
I remember my first fire .
I was the second volunte@@ er on the scene , so there was a pretty good chance I was going to get in .
But still it was a real fo@@ o@@ trace against the other volunte@@ ers to get to the cap@@ t@@ ain in charge to find out what our as@@ sign@@ ments would be .
When I found the cap@@ t@@ ain , he was having a very engag@@ ing conversation with the hom@@ e@@ ow@@ ner , who was su@@ rely having one of the worst days of her life .
Here it was , the middle of the night , she was standing outside in the pour@@ ing rain , under an um@@ b@@ rel@@ la , in her p@@ a@@ jam@@ as , b@@ are@@ foot , while her house was in fl@@ ames .
The other volunte@@ er who had arrived just before me -- let &apos;s call him Le@@ x Lu@@ ther -- got to the cap@@ t@@ ain first and was asked to go inside and save the hom@@ e@@ ow@@ ner &apos;s dog .
The dog ! I was stun@@ ned with je@@ al@@ ous@@ y .
Here was some law@@ yer or money man@@ ager who , for the rest of his life , gets to tell people that he went into a bur@@ ning building to save a living cre@@ ature , just because he beat me by five seconds .
Well , I was next .
The cap@@ t@@ ain w@@ av@@ ed me over .
He said , &quot; Be@@ z@@ os , I need you to go into the house .
I need you to go up@@ st@@ airs , past the fire , and I need you to get this woman a pair of shoes . &quot;
I sw@@ ear .
So , not exactly what I was hop@@ ing for , but off I went -- up the st@@ airs , down the h@@ all , past the &apos; real &apos; fi@@ re@@ fi@@ gh@@ ters , who were pretty much done putting out the fire at this point , into the master be@@ dro@@ om to get a pair of shoes .
Now I know what you &apos;re thinking , but I &apos;m no her@@ o .
I car@@ ried my pay@@ load back down@@ st@@ airs where I met my n@@ em@@ es@@ is and the pre@@ ci@@ ous dog by the front door .
We took our tre@@ a@@ sures outside to the hom@@ e@@ ow@@ ner , where , not surpris@@ ingly , his received much more attention than did mine .
A few weeks later , the de@@ partment received a letter from the hom@@ e@@ ow@@ ner th@@ an@@ king us for the val@@ i@@ ant effort dis@@ played in saving her home .
The act of k@@ ind@@ ness she not@@ ed above all others : someone had even gotten her a pair of shoes .
In both my voc@@ ation at Rob@@ in H@@ ood and my av@@ oc@@ ation as a volunte@@ er fi@@ re@@ fi@@ ghter , I am wit@@ ness to acts of gener@@ os@@ ity and k@@ ind@@ ness on a mon@@ u@@ mental scale , but I &apos;m also wit@@ ness to acts of gr@@ ace and courage on an individual basis .
And you know what I &apos;ve learned ?
They all matter .
So as I look around this room at people who either have achiev@@ ed , or are on their way to achiev@@ ing , remarkable levels of success , I would offer this re@@ min@@ der : don &apos;t wait .
Don &apos;t wait until you make your first million to make a difference in somebody &apos;s life .
If you have something to give , give it now .
Ser@@ ve food at a sou@@ p kitch@@ en . C@@ le@@ an up a neighborhood park .
B@@ e a ment@@ or .
Not every day is going to offer us a chance to save somebody &apos;s life , but every day off@@ ers us an opportunity to affect one .
So get in the game . S@@ ave the shoes .
Thank you .
Brun@@ o Gi@@ us@@ san@@ i : Mark , Mark , come back .
Mark Be@@ z@@ os : Thank you .
This may sound strange , but I &apos;m a big fan of the concre@@ te block .
The first concre@@ te blocks were manufactu@@ red in 18@@ 6@@ 8 with a very simple idea : mo@@ du@@ les made of c@@ ement of a fix@@ ed measu@@ rement that fit together .
Very quickly concre@@ te blocks became the mo@@ st-@@ used construction unit in the world .
They en@@ ab@@ led us to to build things that were larger than us , buildings , bri@@ d@@ ges , one bri@@ ck at a time .
Ess@@ enti@@ ally concre@@ te blocks had become the building block of our time .
Al@@ most a hundred years later in 194@@ 7 , L@@ E@@ G@@ O came up with this .
It was called the Au@@ tom@@ atic B@@ in@@ ding Bri@@ ck .
And in a few short years , L@@ E@@ G@@ O bri@@ cks took place in every hou@@ se@@ hold .
It &apos;s estim@@ ated that over 400 billion bri@@ cks have been produced -- or 75 bri@@ cks for every person on the planet .
You don &apos;t have to be an engineer to make beautiful houses , beautiful bri@@ d@@ ges , beautiful buildings .
L@@ E@@ G@@ O made it accessible .
L@@ E@@ G@@ O has essentially taken the concre@@ te block , the building block of the world , and made it into the building block of our imagination .
Me@@ an@@ while the exact same year , at B@@ ell L@@ ab@@ s the next revolution was about to be announc@@ ed , the next building block .
The trans@@ ist@@ or was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of st@@ atic bri@@ cks pil@@ ed on top of each other to a world where everything was inter@@ active .
Like the concre@@ te block , the trans@@ ist@@ or allows you to build much larger , more complex circuits , one bri@@ ck at a time .
But there &apos;s a main difference : The trans@@ ist@@ or was only for experts .
I person@@ ally don &apos;t accept this , that the building block of our time is res@@ er@@ ved for experts , so I decided to change that .
E@@ ight years ago when I was at the Me@@ dia Lab , I started explor@@ ing this idea of how to put the power of engineers in the hands of artists and designers .
A few years ago I started developing lit@@ t@@ le@@ B@@ its .
Let me show you how they work .
L@@ it@@ t@@ le@@ B@@ its are electron@@ ic mo@@ du@@ les with each one specific function .
They &apos;re pre-@@ engine@@ ered to be light , sound , mot@@ ors and sens@@ ors .
And the best part about it is they sn@@ ap together with mag@@ nets .
So you can &apos;t put them the wrong way .
The bri@@ cks are color@@ -@@ co@@ ded .
Gre@@ en is out@@ put , blue is power , p@@ ink is in@@ put and orange is w@@ ire .
So all you need to do is sn@@ ap a blue to a green and very quickly you can start making larger circuits .
You put a blue to a green , you can make light .
You can put a kno@@ b in between and now you &apos;ve made a little di@@ m@@ mer .
S@@ wit@@ ch out the kno@@ b for a pul@@ se mo@@ du@@ le , which is here , and now you &apos;ve made a little bl@@ in@@ ker .
Ad@@ d this bu@@ zz@@ er for some extra p@@ unch and you &apos;ve created a noise machine .
I &apos;m going to stop that .
So beyond simple play , lit@@ t@@ le@@ B@@ its are actually pretty powerful .
Instead of having to program , to w@@ ire , to sol@@ der , lit@@ t@@ le@@ B@@ its allow you to program using very simple intu@@ itive ges@@ tures .
So to make this bl@@ ink faster or s@@ lower , you would just turn this kno@@ b and basically make it pul@@ se faster or s@@ lower .
The idea behind lit@@ t@@ le@@ B@@ its is that it &apos;s a growing libr@@ ary .
We want to make every single interaction in the world into a read@@ y-@@ to-@@ use bri@@ ck .
Li@@ ghts , sounds , solar pan@@ els , mot@@ ors -- everything should be accessible .
We &apos;ve been giving lit@@ t@@ le@@ B@@ its to kids and seeing them play with them .
And it &apos;s been an incredible experience .
The nic@@ est thing is how they start to understand the electron@@ ics around them from everyday that they don &apos;t learn at schools .
For example , how a ni@@ ght@@ light works , or why an el@@ ev@@ ator door st@@ ays open , or how an iP@@ od respon@@ ds to touch .
We &apos;ve also been taking lit@@ t@@ le@@ B@@ its to design schools .
So for example , we &apos;ve had designers with no experience with electron@@ ics what@@ so@@ ever start to play with lit@@ t@@ le@@ B@@ its as a material .
Here you see , with felt and paper water bot@@ t@@ les , we have Ge@@ or@@ die making ...
A few weeks ago we took lit@@ t@@ le@@ B@@ its to R@@ IS@@ D and gave them to some designers with no experience in engineering what@@ so@@ ever -- just car@@ d@@ board , wood and paper -- and told them &quot; M@@ ake something . &quot;
Here &apos;s an example of a project they made , a mo@@ ti@@ on-@@ activ@@ ated conf@@ et@@ ti can@@ on ball .
But wait , this is actually my favorite project .
It &apos;s a lob@@ ster made of play@@ d@@ ough that &apos;s afraid of the dark .
To these non-@@ engineers , lit@@ t@@ le@@ B@@ its became another material , electron@@ ics became just another material .
And we want to make this material accessible to everyone .
So lit@@ t@@ le@@ B@@ its is open-source .
You can go on the website , down@@ load all the design fi@@ les , make them yourself .
We want to encourage a world of cre@@ ators , of invent@@ ors , of contribu@@ tors , because this world that we live in , this inter@@ active world , is ours .
So go ahead and start invent@@ ing .
Thank you .
Today I &apos;m going to talk about un@@ expected disco@@ ver@@ ies .
Now I work in the solar technology industry .
And my small star@@ tu@@ p is looking to force ourselves into the environment by paying attention to ...
... paying attention to crow@@ d-@@ sour@@ c@@ ing .
It &apos;s just a quick video of what we do .
Hu@@ h . H@@ ang on a moment .
It might take a moment to load .
We &apos;ll just -- we can just ski@@ p -- I &apos;ll just ski@@ p through the video instead ...
No .
This is not ...
Okay .
Sol@@ ar technology is ...
Oh , that &apos;s all my time ?
Okay . Thank you very much .
So a couple of years ago I started a program to try to get the ro@@ ck@@ star tech and design people to take a year off and work in the one environment that represents pretty much everything they &apos;re supposed to hate ; we have them work in government .
The program is called C@@ ode for America , and it &apos;s a little bit like a P@@ ea@@ ce Cor@@ ps for ge@@ e@@ ks .
We sel@@ ect a few fel@@ lows every year and we have them work with city governments .
Instead of sending them off into the Th@@ ird World , we send them into the wil@@ ds of City H@@ all .
And there they make great app@@ s , they work with city st@@ aff@@ ers .
But really what they &apos;re doing is they &apos;re showing what &apos;s possible with technology today .
So meet Al .
Al is a fire hy@@ dr@@ ant in the city of Boston .
Here it kind of looks like he &apos;s looking for a date , but what he &apos;s really looking for is for someone to sho@@ v@@ el him out when he gets s@@ no@@ wed in , because he knows he &apos;s not very good at fighting fi@@ res when he &apos;s covered in four feet of s@@ now .
Now how did he come to be looking for help in this very unique man@@ ner ?
We had a team of fel@@ lows in Boston last year through the C@@ ode for America program .
They were there in Fe@@ bru@@ ary , and it s@@ no@@ wed a lot in Fe@@ bru@@ ary last year .
And they noticed that the city never gets to di@@ gg@@ ing out these fire hy@@ dr@@ ants .
But one fellow in particular , a guy named Eri@@ k Mi@@ cha@@ el@@ s-@@ O@@ ber , noticed something else , and that &apos;s that citizens are sho@@ v@@ eling out si@@ de@@ wal@@ ks right in front of these things .
So he did what any good develop@@ er would do , he wrote an ap@@ p .
It &apos;s a cu@@ te little ap@@ p where you can adop@@ t a fire hy@@ dr@@ ant .
So you agree to di@@ g it out when it s@@ no@@ ws .
If you do , you get to name it , and he called the first one Al .
And if you don &apos;t , someone can ste@@ al it from you .
So it &apos;s got cu@@ te little game dynam@@ ics on it .
This is a mod@@ est little ap@@ p .
It &apos;s probably the small@@ est of the 21 app@@ s that the fel@@ lows wrote last year .
But it &apos;s doing something that no other government technology does .
It &apos;s sp@@ reading vir@@ ally .
There &apos;s a guy in the I@@ .@@ T@@ . de@@ partment of the City of H@@ on@@ ol@@ ul@@ u who saw this ap@@ p and realized that he could use it , not for s@@ now , but to get citizens to adop@@ t t@@ su@@ nam@@ i si@@ r@@ ens .
It &apos;s very important that these t@@ su@@ nam@@ i si@@ r@@ ens work , but people ste@@ al the batter@@ ies out of them .
So he &apos;s getting citizens to check on them .
And then Se@@ at@@ tle decided to use it to get citizens to clear out c@@ log@@ ged stor@@ m dr@@ ains .
And Chicago just rol@@ led it out to get people to sign up to sho@@ v@@ el si@@ de@@ wal@@ ks when it s@@ no@@ ws .
So we now know of nine cities that are planning to use this .
And this has spread just fri@@ c@@ tion@@ less@@ ly , organ@@ ically , natur@@ ally .
If you know anything about government technology , you know that this isn &apos;t how it normally goes .
Pro@@ cur@@ ing software usually takes a couple of years .
We had a team that worked on a project in Boston last year that took three people about two and a half months .
It was a way that parents could figure out which were the right public schools for their kids .
We were told after@@ ward that if that had gone through normal ch@@ ann@@ els , it would have taken at least two years and it would have cost about two million dollars .
And that &apos;s nothing .
There is one project in the California court system right now that so far cost tax@@ pay@@ ers two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
And there are projects like this at every level of government .
So an ap@@ p that takes a couple of days to write and then sp@@ re@@ ads vir@@ ally , that &apos;s sort of a shot across the b@@ ow to the institution of government .
It suggests how government could work better -- not more like a private company , as many people think it should .
And not even like a tech company , but more like the Internet itself .
And that means per@@ mis@@ sion@@ less , it means open , it means gener@@ ative .
And that &apos;s important .
But what &apos;s more important about this ap@@ p is that it represents how a new generation is t@@ ack@@ ling the problem of government -- not as the problem of an os@@ si@@ fied institution , but as a problem of collective action .
And that &apos;s great news , because , it turns out , we &apos;re very good at collective action with digital technology .
Now there &apos;s a very large community of people that are building the tools that we need to do things together effectively .
It &apos;s not just C@@ ode for America fel@@ lows , there are hundreds of people all over the country that are standing and writing civi@@ c app@@ s every day in their own communities .
They haven &apos;t given up on government .
They are frustr@@ ated as hell with it , but they &apos;re not compl@@ aining about it , they &apos;re fix@@ ing it .
And these folks know something that we &apos;ve lost sight of .
And that &apos;s that when you stri@@ p away all your feelings about politics and the line at the D@@ M@@ V and all those other things that we &apos;re really ma@@ d about , government is , at its core , in the words of Ti@@ m O &apos;@@ Re@@ il@@ ly , &quot; What we do together that we can &apos;t do alone . &quot;
Now a lot of people have given up on government .
And if you &apos;re one of those people , I would ask that you re@@ consider , because things are changing .
Po@@ li@@ tics is not changing ; government is changing .
And because government ultimately der@@ i@@ ves its power from us -- remember &quot; We the people ? &quot; -- how we think about it is going to effect how that change happens .
Now I didn &apos;t know very much about government when I started this program .
And like a lot of people , I thought government was basically about getting people elec@@ ted to office .
Well after two years , I &apos;ve come to the conclusion that , especially local government , is about o@@ pos@@ su@@ ms .
This is the call center for the services and information line .
It &apos;s gener@@ ally where you will get if you call 3@@ 11 in your city .
If you should ever have the chance to staf@@ f your city &apos;s call center , as our fellow Scot@@ t S@@ il@@ ver@@ man did as part of the program -- in fact , they all do that -- you will find that people call government with a very wide range of issues , including having an o@@ pos@@ sum stuck in your house .
So Scot@@ t gets this call .
He types &quot; O@@ pos@@ sum &quot; into this offici@@ al knowledge base .
He doesn &apos;t really come up with anything . He starts with animal control .
And finally , he says , &quot; Look , can you just open all the do@@ ors to your house and play music really l@@ oud and see if the thing leaves ? &quot;
So that worked . So bo@@ oy@@ a for Scot@@ t .
But that wasn &apos;t the end of the o@@ pos@@ su@@ ms .
Boston doesn &apos;t just have a call center .
It has an ap@@ p , a Web and mobile ap@@ p , called C@@ iti@@ z@@ ens C@@ onn@@ ect .
Now we didn &apos;t write this ap@@ p .
This is the work of the very smart people at the O@@ ff@@ ice of New U@@ r@@ ban Me@@ chan@@ ics in Boston .
So one day -- this is an actual report -- this came in : &quot; O@@ pos@@ sum in my tr@@ ash@@ can . Can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s dead .
How do I get this re@@ moved ? &quot;
But what happens with C@@ iti@@ z@@ ens C@@ onn@@ ect is different .
So Scot@@ t was speaking pers@@ on-@@ to-@@ person .
But on C@@ iti@@ z@@ ens C@@ onn@@ ect everything is public , so everybody can see this .
And in this case , a neighb@@ or saw it .
And the next report we got said , &quot; I walked over to this location , found the tr@@ ash@@ can behind the house .
O@@ pos@@ sum ? Ch@@ ec@@ k . L@@ iv@@ ing ? Y@@ ep .
Tur@@ ned tr@@ ash@@ can on its side . Wal@@ ked home .
Goo@@ d@@ night swe@@ et o@@ pos@@ sum . &quot;
P@@ ret@@ ty simple .
So this is great . This is the digital meeting the physical .
And it &apos;s also a great example of government getting in on the crow@@ d-@@ sour@@ c@@ ing game .
But it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
And I don &apos;t mean necessarily a techno@@ logical definition of platform here .
I &apos;m just talking about a platform for people to help themselves and to help others .
So one citiz@@ en helped another citiz@@ en , but government played a key role here .
It connected those two people .
And it could have connected them with government services if they &apos;d been needed , but a neighb@@ or is a far better and che@@ aper alternative to government services .
When one neighb@@ or helps another , we str@@ eng@@ then our communities .
We call animal control , it just costs a lot of money .
Now one of the important things we need to think about government is that it &apos;s not the same thing as politics .
And most people get that , but they think that one is the in@@ put to the other .
That our in@@ put to the system of government is vot@@ ing .
Now how many times have we elec@@ ted a political leader -- and sometimes we spend a lot of energy getting a new political leader elec@@ ted -- and then we sit back and we expect government to refl@@ ect our values and meet our needs , and then not that much changes ?
That &apos;s because government is like a vast ocean and politics is the six@@ -@@ in@@ ch layer on top .
And what &apos;s under that is what we call bure@@ au@@ cracy .
And we say that word with such con@@ temp@@ t .
But it &apos;s that con@@ temp@@ t that kee@@ ps this thing that we own and we pay for as something that &apos;s working against us , this other thing , and then we &apos;re dis@@ em@@ power@@ ing ourselves .
People seem to think politics is sex@@ y .
If we want this institution to work for us , we &apos;re going to have to make bure@@ au@@ cracy sex@@ y .
Because that &apos;s where the real work of government happens .
We have to engage with the mach@@ in@@ ery of government .
So that &apos;s Oc@@ cu@@ py@@ the@@ S@@ E@@ C movement has done .
Have you seen these guys ?
It &apos;s a group of concerned citizens that have written a very det@@ ailed 3@@ 25@@ -@@ page report that &apos;s a response to the S@@ E@@ C &apos;s requ@@ est for comment on the Fin@@ anci@@ al Re@@ form Bill .
That &apos;s not being poli@@ tically active , that &apos;s being bure@@ au@@ crati@@ cally active .
Now for those of us who &apos;ve given up on government , it &apos;s time that we asked ourselves about the world that we want to leave for our children .
You have to see the enormous challenges that they &apos;re going to face .
Do we really think we &apos;re going to get where we need to go without fix@@ ing the one institution that can act on be@@ half of all of us ?
We can &apos;t do without government , but we do need it to be more effective .
The good news is that technology is making it possible to fundament@@ ally re@@ frame the function of government in a way that can actually scale by str@@ eng@@ th@@ ening civil society .
And there &apos;s a generation out there that &apos;s grown up on the Internet , and they know that it &apos;s not that hard to do things together , you just have to archit@@ ect the systems the right way .
Now the average age of our fel@@ lows is 28 , so I am , be@@ gr@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ ingly , almost a generation older than most of them .
This is a generation that &apos;s grown up taking their voices pretty much for gran@@ ted .
They &apos;re not fighting that bat@@ tle that we &apos;re all fighting about who gets to speak ; they all get to speak .
They can express their opinion on any chan@@ nel at any time , and they do .
So when they &apos;re fac@@ ed with the problem of government , they don &apos;t care as much about using their voices .
They &apos;re using their hands .
They &apos;re using their hands to write applications that make government work better .
And those applications let us use our hands to make our communities better .
That could be sho@@ v@@ eling out a hy@@ dr@@ ant , pul@@ ling a we@@ ed , turning over a gar@@ bage can with an o@@ pos@@ sum in it .
And certainly , we could have been sho@@ v@@ eling out those fire hy@@ dr@@ ants all along , and many people do .
But these app@@ s are like little digital re@@ min@@ ders that we &apos;re not just consum@@ ers , and we &apos;re not just consum@@ ers of government , putting in our tax@@ es and getting back services .
We &apos;re more than that , we &apos;re citizens .
And we &apos;re not going to fix government until we fix citiz@@ en@@ ship .
So the question I have for all of you here : When it comes to the big , important things that we need to do together , all of us together , are we just going to be a crow@@ d of voices , or are we also going to be a crow@@ d of hands ?
Thank you .
Well this is a really extraordinary hon@@ or for me .
I spend most of my time in j@@ ails , in prisons , on death row .
I spend most of my time in very low-@@ income communities in the projects and places where there &apos;s a great deal of hop@@ el@@ ess@@ ness .
And being here at TED and seeing the stimul@@ ation , hearing it , has been very , very en@@ er@@ gi@@ zing to me .
And one of the things that &apos;s emerg@@ ed in my short time here is that TED has an identity .
And you can actually say things here that have impacts around the world .
And sometimes when it comes through TED , it has meaning and power that it doesn &apos;t have when it doesn &apos;t .
And I mention that because I think identity is really important .
And we &apos;ve had some fantastic pres@@ ent@@ ations .
And I think what we &apos;ve learned is that , if you &apos;re a teacher your words can be meaning@@ ful , but if you &apos;re a compas@@ sionate teacher , they can be especially meaning@@ ful .
If you &apos;re a doctor you can do some good things , but if you &apos;re a car@@ ing doctor you can do some other things .
And so I want to talk about the power of identity .
And I didn &apos;t learn about this actually prac@@ tic@@ ing law and doing the work that I do .
I actually learned about this from my grandmother .
I grew up in a house that was the traditional Afri@@ can@@ -@@ American home that was domin@@ ated by a ma@@ tri@@ ar@@ ch , and that ma@@ tri@@ ar@@ ch was my grandmother .
She was tough , she was strong , she was powerful .
She was the end of every argument in our family .
She was the beginning of a lot of arguments in our family .
She was the daughter of people who were actually en@@ sl@@ av@@ ed .
Her parents were born in sl@@ av@@ ery in Vir@@ gin@@ ia in the 18@@ 40 &apos;s .
She was born in the 18@@ 80 &apos;s and the experience of sl@@ av@@ ery very much shap@@ ed the way she saw the world .
And my grandmother was tough , but she was also lo@@ ving .
When I would see her as a little boy , she &apos;d come up to me and she &apos;d give me these hu@@ gs .
And she &apos;d squ@@ e@@ e@@ ze me so ti@@ ght I could bar@@ ely brea@@ the and then she &apos;d let me go .
And an hour or two later , if I saw her , she &apos;d come over to me and she &apos;d say , &quot; Br@@ y@@ an , do you still feel me hu@@ gg@@ ing you ? &quot;
And if I said , &quot; No , &quot; she &apos;d ass@@ au@@ lt me again , and if I said , &quot; Yes , &quot; she &apos;d leave me alone .
And she just had this quality that you always wanted to be near her .
And the only challenge was that she had 10 children .
My mom was the youn@@ g@@ est of her 10 kids .
And sometimes when I would go and spend time with her , it would be difficult to get her time and attention .
My cous@@ ins would be running around everywhere .
And I remember , when I was about eight or nine years old , w@@ aking up one morning , going into the living room , and all of my cous@@ ins were running around .
And my grandmother was sitting across the room star@@ ing at me .
And at first I thought we were playing a game .
And I would look at her and I &apos;d s@@ mile , but she was very serious .
And after about 15 or 20 minutes of this , she got up and she came across the room and she took me by the hand and she said , &quot; Come on , Br@@ y@@ an . You and I are going to have a talk . &quot;
And I remember this just like it happened yesterday .
I never will forget it .
She took me out back and she said , &quot; Br@@ y@@ an , I &apos;m going to tell you something , but you don &apos;t tell anybody what I tell you . &quot;
I said , &quot; Okay , M@@ ama . &quot;
She said , &quot; Now you make sure you don &apos;t do that . &quot; I said , &quot; Su@@ re . &quot;
Then she sat me down and she looked at me and she said , &quot; I want you to know I &apos;ve been watching you . &quot;
And she said , &quot; I think you &apos;re special . &quot;
She said , &quot; I think you can do anything you want to do . &quot;
I will never forget it .
And then she said , &quot; I just need you to promise me three things , Br@@ y@@ an . &quot;
I said , &quot; Okay , M@@ ama . &quot;
She said , &quot; The first thing I want you to promise me is that you &apos;ll always love your mom . &quot;
She said , &quot; That &apos;s my baby girl , and you have to promise me now you &apos;ll always take care of her . &quot;
Well I ado@@ red my mom , so I said , &quot; Yes , M@@ ama . I &apos;ll do that . &quot;
Then she said , &quot; The second thing I want you to promise me is that you &apos;ll always do the right thing even when the right thing is the hard thing . &quot;
And I thought about it and I said , &quot; Yes , M@@ ama . I &apos;ll do that . &quot;
Then finally she said , &quot; The third thing I want you to promise me is that you &apos;ll never drink al@@ co@@ ho@@ l . &quot;
Well I was nine years old , so I said , &quot; Yes , M@@ ama . I &apos;ll do that . &quot;
I grew up in the country in the rural South , and I have a brother a year older than me and a sister a year youn@@ ger .
When I was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home and he had this six@@ -@@ p@@ ack of be@@ er -- I don &apos;t know where he got it -- and he gr@@ ab@@ bed me and my sister and we went out in the woo@@ ds .
And we were kind of just out there doing the stuff we craz@@ ily did .
And he had a si@@ p of this be@@ er and he gave some to my sister and she had some , and they off@@ ered it to me .
I said , &quot; No , no , no . That &apos;s okay . You all go ahead . I &apos;m not going to have any be@@ er . &quot;
My brother said , &quot; Come on . We &apos;re doing this today ; you always do what we do .
I had some , your sister had some . Have some be@@ er . &quot;
I said , &quot; No , I don &apos;t feel right about that . Y &apos;@@ all go ahead . Y &apos;@@ all go ahead . &quot;
And then my brother started star@@ ing at me .
He said , &quot; What &apos;s wrong with you ? Have some be@@ er . &quot;
Then he looked at me real hard and he said , &quot; Oh , I hope you &apos;re not still hun@@ g up on that conversation M@@ ama had with you . &quot;
I said , &quot; Well , what are you talking about ? &quot;
He said , &quot; Oh , M@@ ama tells all the grand@@ kids that they &apos;re special . &quot;
I was dev@@ ast@@ ated .
And I &apos;m going to ad@@ mit something to you .
I &apos;m going to tell you something I probably shouldn &apos;t .
I know this might be broad@@ c@@ ast broad@@ ly .
But I &apos;m 5@@ 2 years old , and I &apos;m going to ad@@ mit to you that I &apos;ve never had a drop of al@@ co@@ ho@@ l .
I don &apos;t say that because I think that &apos;s virtu@@ ous ; I say that because there is power in identity .
When we create the right kind of identity , we can say things to the world around us that they don &apos;t actually believe makes sense .
We can get them to do things that they don &apos;t think they can do .
When I thought about my grandmother , of course she would think all her grand@@ kids were special .
My grand@@ father was in prison during pro@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion .
My male un@@ cles died of al@@ co@@ hol@@ -@@ related diseases .
And these were the things she thought we needed to comm@@ it to .
Well I &apos;ve been trying to say something about our crimin@@ al justice system .
This country is very different today than it was 40 years ago .
In 197@@ 2 , there were 3@@ 00,000 people in j@@ ails and prisons .
Today , there are 2.@@ 3 million .
The United States now has the highest rate of incar@@ cer@@ ation in the world .
We have seven million people on prob@@ ation and par@@ ole .
And mass incar@@ cer@@ ation , in my jud@@ gment , has fundament@@ ally changed our world .
In poor communities , in communities of color there is this des@@ pair , there is this hop@@ el@@ ess@@ ness , that is being shap@@ ed by these out@@ comes .
One out of three black men between the ages of 18 and 30 is in j@@ ail , in prison , on prob@@ ation or par@@ ole .
In urban communities across this country -- Los Angeles , Phil@@ ad@@ el@@ ph@@ ia , Bal@@ ti@@ more , Washington -- 50 to 60 percent of all young men of color are in j@@ ail or prison or on prob@@ ation or par@@ ole .
Our system isn &apos;t just being shap@@ ed in these ways that seem to be dist@@ or@@ ting around race , they &apos;re also dist@@ or@@ ted by poverty .
We have a system of justice in this country that tre@@ ats you much better if you &apos;re rich and gu@@ il@@ ty than if you &apos;re poor and inno@@ cent .
We@@ alth , not cul@@ p@@ ability , shapes out@@ comes .
And yet , we seem to be very comfortable .
The politics of fear and anger have made us believe that these are problems that are not our problems .
We &apos;ve been dis@@ connected .
It &apos;s interesting to me .
We &apos;re looking at some very interesting develop@@ ments in our work .
My state of Al@@ ab@@ ama , like a number of states , actually perman@@ ently dis@@ en@@ fran@@ ch@@ ises you if you have a crimin@@ al convic@@ tion .
Right now in Al@@ ab@@ ama 3@@ 4 percent of the black male population has perman@@ ently lost the right to vote .
We &apos;re actually proj@@ ecting in another 10 years the level of dis@@ en@@ fran@@ ch@@ is@@ ement will be as high as it &apos;s been since pri@@ or to the passage of the V@@ oting Ri@@ ghts Ac@@ t .
And there is this stun@@ ning silence .
I represent children .
A lot of my clients are very young .
The United States is the only country in the world where we sentence 1@@ 3@@ -year-old children to die in prison .
We have life im@@ pris@@ on@@ ment without par@@ ole for kids in this country .
And we &apos;re actually doing some li@@ ti@@ gation .
The only country in the world .
I represent people on death row .
It &apos;s interesting , this question of the death pen@@ al@@ ty .
In many ways , we &apos;ve been taught to think that the real question is , do people des@@ erve to die for the crimes they &apos;ve commit@@ ted ?
And that &apos;s a very sensi@@ ble question .
But there &apos;s another way of thinking about where we are in our identity .
The other way of thinking about it is not , do people des@@ erve to die for the crimes they comm@@ it , but do we des@@ erve to kill ?
I mean , it &apos;s fascinating .
De@@ ath pen@@ al@@ ty in America is defined by er@@ ror .
For every nine people who have been ex@@ ecu@@ ted , we &apos;ve actually identi@@ fied one inno@@ cent person who &apos;s been ex@@ on@@ er@@ ated and released from death row .
A kind of as@@ ton@@ ishing er@@ ror rate -- one out of nine people inno@@ cent .
I mean , it &apos;s fascinating .
In avi@@ ation , we would never let people fly on air@@ plan@@ es if for every nine plan@@ es that took off one would cr@@ ash .
But somehow we can insul@@ ate ourselves from this problem .
It &apos;s not our problem .
It &apos;s not our bur@@ den .
It &apos;s not our struggle .
I talk a lot about these issues .
I talk about race and this question of whether we des@@ erve to kill .
And it &apos;s interesting , when I teach my students about Afri@@ can@@ -@@ American history , I tell them about sl@@ av@@ ery .
I tell them about terrorism , the era that began at the end of re@@ construction that went on to World War II .
We don &apos;t really know very much about it .
But for Afri@@ can@@ -@@ Americans in this country , that was an era defined by ter@@ ror .
In many communities , people had to worry about being ly@@ n@@ ched .
They had to worry about being bomb@@ ed .
It was the threat of ter@@ ror that shap@@ ed their lives .
And these older people come up to me now and they say , &quot; Mr. St@@ even@@ son , you give talks , you make spe@@ e@@ ches , you tell people to stop saying we &apos;re dealing with terrorism for the first time in our nation &apos;s history after 9 / 11 . &quot;
They tell me to say , &quot; No , tell them that we grew up with that . &quot;
And that era of terrorism , of course , was followed by se@@ gre@@ gation and decades of rac@@ ial sub@@ ordin@@ ation and ap@@ ar@@ the@@ id .
And yet , we have in this country this dynamic where we really don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
We don &apos;t like to talk about our history .
And because of that , we really haven &apos;t understood what it &apos;s meant to do the things we &apos;ve done histor@@ ically .
We &apos;re constantly running into each other .
We &apos;re constantly creating ten@@ sions and conflic@@ ts .
We have a hard time talking about race , and I believe it &apos;s because we are un@@ willing to comm@@ it ourselves to a process of truth and re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation .
In South Africa , people understood that we couldn &apos;t over@@ come ap@@ ar@@ the@@ id without a commit@@ ment to truth and re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation .
In Rwanda , even after the gen@@ o@@ cide , there was this commit@@ ment , but in this country we haven &apos;t done that .
I was giving some lec@@ tures in Germany about the death pen@@ al@@ ty .
It was fascinating because one of the sch@@ ol@@ ars stood up after the pres@@ entation and said , &quot; Well you know it &apos;s deeply trou@@ bling to hear what you &apos;re talking about . &quot;
He said , &quot; We don &apos;t have the death pen@@ al@@ ty in Germany .
And of course , we can never have the death pen@@ al@@ ty in Germany . &quot;
And the room got very qui@@ et , and this woman said , &quot; There &apos;s no way , with our history , we could ever engage in the syst@@ em@@ atic killing of human beings .
It would be un@@ consci@@ on@@ able for us to , in an in@@ tenti@@ onal and deli@@ ber@@ ate way , set about ex@@ ecu@@ ting people . &quot;
And I thought about that .
What would it feel like to be living in a world where the nation state of Germany was ex@@ ecu@@ ting people , especially if they were dis@@ propor@@ tion@@ ately Je@@ wish ?
I couldn &apos;t bear it .
It would be un@@ consci@@ on@@ able .
And yet , in this country , in the states of the O@@ ld South , we ex@@ ecu@@ te people -- where you &apos;re 11 times more likely to get the death pen@@ al@@ ty if the victi@@ m is white than if the victi@@ m is black , 22 times more likely to get it if the def@@ end@@ ant is black and the victi@@ m is white -- in the very states where there are bu@@ ried in the ground the bodies of people who were ly@@ n@@ ched .
And yet , there is this dis@@ connect .
Well I believe that our identity is at risk .
That when we actually don &apos;t care about these difficult things , the positive and wonderful things are non@@ eth@@ eless implic@@ ated .
We love innovation .
We love technology . We love creativity .
We love entert@@ ain@@ ment .
But ultimately , those re@@ alities are sh@@ ado@@ wed by suffering , ab@@ use , de@@ grad@@ ation , mar@@ gin@@ alization .
And for me , it becomes necessary to integr@@ ate the two .
Because ultimately we are talking about a need to be more hop@@ eful , more commit@@ ted , more de@@ dic@@ ated to the basic challenges of living in a complex world .
And for me that means spending time thinking and talking about the poor , the dis@@ adv@@ ant@@ aged , those who will never get to TED .
But thinking about them in a way that is integr@@ ated in our own lives .
You know ultimately , we all have to believe things we haven &apos;t seen .
We do . As rational as we are , as commit@@ ted to intell@@ ect as we are .
In@@ nov@@ ation , creativity , development comes not from the ideas in our mind alone .
They come from the ideas in our mind that are also fu@@ eled by some convic@@ tion in our heart .
And it &apos;s that min@@ d-@@ heart connection that I believe comp@@ els us to not just be atten@@ tive to all the bright and d@@ az@@ z@@ ly things , but also the dark and difficult things .
V@@ ac@@ la@@ v H@@ av@@ el , the great C@@ z@@ ech leader , talked about this .
He said , &quot; When we were in E@@ as@@ tern Europe and dealing with op@@ pression , we wanted all kinds of things , but mostly what we needed was hope , an ori@@ entation of the spirit , a w@@ ill@@ ing@@ ness to sometimes be in hop@@ eless places and be a wit@@ ness . &quot;
Well that ori@@ entation of the spirit is very much at the core of what I believe even TED communities have to be engaged in .
There is no dis@@ connect around technology and design that will allow us to be fully human until we pay attention to suffering , to poverty , to exclu@@ sion , to un@@ fair@@ ness , to in@@ justice .
Now I will war@@ n you that this kind of identity is a much more challeng@@ ing identity than ones that don &apos;t pay attention to this .
It will get to you .
I had the great privil@@ e@@ ge , when I was a young law@@ yer , of meeting Ro@@ sa Par@@ ks .
And M@@ s@@ . Par@@ ks used to come back to Mon@@ t@@ g@@ om@@ ery every now and then , and she would get together with two of her de@@ ar@@ est friends , these older women , John@@ nie Car@@ r who was the organiz@@ er of the Mon@@ t@@ g@@ om@@ ery bus bo@@ y@@ cot@@ t -- amazing Afri@@ can@@ -@@ American woman -- and Vir@@ gin@@ ia Dur@@ r , a white woman , whose husband , C@@ li@@ ff@@ ord Dur@@ r , repres@@ ented Dr. King .
And these women would get together and just talk .
And every now and then M@@ s@@ . Car@@ r would call me , and she &apos;d say , &quot; Br@@ y@@ an , M@@ s@@ . Par@@ ks is coming to town . We &apos;re going to get together and talk .
Do you want to come over and listen ? &quot;
And I &apos;d say , &quot; Yes , Ma &apos;@@ am , I do . &quot;
And she &apos;d say , &quot; Well what are you going to do when you get here ? &quot;
I said , &quot; I &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
And I &apos;d go over there and I would , I would just listen .
It would be so en@@ er@@ gi@@ zing and so em@@ power@@ ing .
And one time I was over there listening to these women talk , and after a couple of hours M@@ s@@ . Par@@ ks turned to me and she said , &quot; Now Br@@ y@@ an , tell me what the E@@ qu@@ al Jus@@ tice I@@ ni@@ ti@@ ative is .
T@@ ell me what you &apos;re trying to do . &quot;
And I began giving her my ra@@ p .
I said , &quot; Well we &apos;re trying to challenge in@@ justice .
We &apos;re trying to help people who have been wr@@ ong@@ ly convic@@ ted .
We &apos;re trying to con@@ front bi@@ as and discrimin@@ ation in the administration of crimin@@ al justice .
We &apos;re trying to end life without par@@ ole sent@@ ences for children .
We &apos;re trying to do something about the death pen@@ al@@ ty .
We &apos;re trying to reduce the prison population .
We &apos;re trying to end mass incar@@ cer@@ ation . &quot;
I gave her my whole ra@@ p , and when I finished she looked at me and she said , &quot; M@@ mm m@@ mm m@@ mm . &quot;
She said , &quot; That &apos;s going to make you ti@@ red , ti@@ red , ti@@ red . &quot;
And that &apos;s when M@@ s@@ . Car@@ r le@@ an@@ ed forward , she put her finger in my face , she said , &quot; That &apos;s why you &apos;ve got to be br@@ ave , br@@ ave , br@@ ave . &quot;
And I actually believe that the TED community needs to be more cour@@ age@@ ous .
We need to find ways to embr@@ ace these challenges , these problems , the suffering .
Because ultimately , our humanity depends on everyone &apos;s humanity .
I &apos;ve learned very simple things doing the work that I do .
It &apos;s just taught me very simple things .
I &apos;ve come to understand and to believe that each of us is more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
I believe that for every person on the planet .
I think if somebody tells a lie , they &apos;re not just a li@@ ar .
I think if somebody takes something that doesn &apos;t bel@@ ong to them , they &apos;re not just a thi@@ ef .
I think even if you kill someone , you &apos;re not just a kill@@ er .
And because of that there &apos;s this basic human dign@@ ity that must be resp@@ ected by law .
I also believe that in many parts of this country , and certainly in many parts of this globe , that the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
I don &apos;t believe that .
I actually think , in too many places , the opposite of poverty is justice .
And finally , I believe that , despite the fact that it is so dram@@ atic and so beautiful and so inspir@@ ing and so stimul@@ ating , we will ultimately not be jud@@ ged by our technology , we won &apos;t be jud@@ ged by our design , we won &apos;t be jud@@ ged by our intell@@ ect and reason .
U@@ l@@ timately , you ju@@ dge the character of a society , not by how they treat their rich and the powerful and the privil@@ eg@@ ed , but by how they treat the poor , the con@@ dem@@ ned , the incar@@ cer@@ ated .
Because it &apos;s in that n@@ ex@@ us that we actually begin to understand truly profound things about who we are .
I sometimes get out of balance . I &apos;ll end with this story .
I sometimes push too hard .
I do get ti@@ red , as we all do .
Sometimes those ideas get ahead of our thinking in ways that are important .
And I &apos;ve been repres@@ enting these kids who have been sent@@ enced to do these very har@@ s@@ h sent@@ ences .
And I go to the j@@ ail and I see my client who &apos;s 13 and 14 , and he &apos;s been cer@@ ti@@ fied to stand trial as an adult .
I start thinking , well , how did that happen ?
How can a ju@@ dge turn you into something that you &apos;re not ?
And the ju@@ dge has cer@@ ti@@ fied him as an adult , but I see this kid .
And I was up too late one night and I starting thinking , well go@@ s@@ h , if the ju@@ dge can turn you into something that you &apos;re not , the ju@@ dge must have magic power .
Yeah , Br@@ y@@ an , the ju@@ dge has some magic power .
You should ask for some of that .
And because I was up too late , wasn &apos;t thinking real straight , I started working on a motion .
And I had a client who was 14 years old , a young , poor black kid .
And I started working on this motion , and the head of the motion was : &quot; Mo@@ tion to try my poor , 14@@ -year-old black male client like a privil@@ eg@@ ed , white 7@@ 5@@ -year-old corpor@@ ate ex@@ ecu@@ tive . &quot;
And I put in my motion that there was pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ ori@@ al mis@@ conduc@@ t and police mis@@ conduc@@ t and ju@@ di@@ ci@@ al mis@@ conduc@@ t .
There was a crazy line in there about how there &apos;s no conduc@@ t in this coun@@ ty , it &apos;s all mis@@ conduc@@ t .
And the next morning , I w@@ oke up and I thought , now did I dream that crazy motion , or did I actually write it ?
And to my hor@@ ror , not only had I written it , but I had sent it to court .
A couple months went by , and I had just for@@ gotten all about it .
And I finally decided , oh go@@ s@@ h , I &apos;ve got to go to the court and do this crazy case .
And I got into my car and I was feeling really over@@ wh@@ el@@ med -- over@@ wh@@ el@@ med .
And I got in my car and I went to this cour@@ thou@@ se .
And I was thinking , this is going to be so difficult , so pain@@ ful .
And I finally got out of the car and I started walking up to the cour@@ thou@@ se .
And as I was walking up the steps of this cour@@ thou@@ se , there was an older black man who was the j@@ an@@ it@@ or in this cour@@ thou@@ se .
When this man saw me , he came over to me and he said , &quot; Who are you ? &quot;
I said , &quot; I &apos;m a law@@ yer . &quot; He said , &quot; You &apos;re a law@@ yer ? &quot; I said , &quot; Yes , sir . &quot;
And this man came over to me and he hu@@ gg@@ ed me .
And he wh@@ is@@ per@@ ed in my ear .
He said , &quot; I &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
And I have to tell you , it was en@@ er@@ gi@@ zing .
It connected deeply with something in me about identity , about the capacity of every person to contribu@@ te to a community , to a perspective that is hop@@ eful .
Well I went into the cour@@ tro@@ om .
And as soon as I walked inside , the ju@@ dge saw me coming in .
He said , &quot; Mr. St@@ even@@ son , did you write this crazy motion ? &quot;
I said , &quot; Yes , sir . I did . &quot; And we started argu@@ ing .
And people started coming in because they were just ou@@ tr@@ aged .
I had written these crazy things .
And police off@@ ic@@ ers were coming in and ass@@ istant pro@@ sec@@ u@@ tors and cl@@ er@@ k workers .
And before I knew it , the cour@@ tro@@ om was filled with people an@@ gry that we were talking about race , that we were talking about poverty , that we were talking about inequality .
And out of the corner of my eye , I could see this j@@ an@@ it@@ or p@@ ac@@ ing back and forth .
And he kept looking through the window , and he could hear all of this h@@ oll@@ er .
He kept p@@ ac@@ ing back and forth .
And finally , this older black man with this very worried look on his face came into the cour@@ tro@@ om and sat down behind me , almost at coun@@ sel table .
A@@ bout 10 minutes later the ju@@ dge said we would take a break .
And during the break there was a de@@ pu@@ ty sh@@ er@@ i@@ ff who was off@@ ended that the j@@ an@@ it@@ or had come into court .
And this de@@ pu@@ ty ju@@ mp@@ ed up and he ran over to this older black man .
He said , &quot; J@@ im@@ my , what are you doing in this cour@@ tro@@ om ? &quot;
And this older black man stood up and he looked at that de@@ pu@@ ty and he looked at me and he said , &quot; I came into this cour@@ tro@@ om to tell this young man , keep your eyes on the pr@@ ize , hold on . &quot;
I &apos;ve come to TED because I believe that many of you understand that the moral ar@@ c of the universe is long , but it b@@ ends toward justice .
That we cannot be full evolved human beings until we care about human rights and basic dign@@ ity .
That all of our survival is ti@@ ed to the survival of everyone .
That our visions of technology and design and entert@@ ain@@ ment and creativity have to be married with visions of humanity , compassion and justice .
And more than anything , for those of you who share that , I &apos;ve simply come to tell you to keep your eyes on the pr@@ ize , hold on .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : So you heard and saw an obvious desire by this audience , this community , to help you on your way and to do something on this issue .
O@@ ther than writing a check , what could we do ?
B@@ S : Well there are opportunities all around us .
If you live in the state of California , for example , there &apos;s a refer@@ end@@ um coming up this spring where actually there &apos;s going to be an effort to re@@ direct some of the money we spend on the politics of pun@@ ish@@ ment .
For example , here in California we &apos;re going to spend one billion dollars on the death pen@@ al@@ ty in the next five years -- one billion dollars .
And yet , 4@@ 6 percent of all hom@@ ici@@ de cases don &apos;t result in arr@@ est .
5@@ 6 percent of all rap@@ e cases don &apos;t result .
So there &apos;s an opportunity to change that .
And this refer@@ end@@ um would propose having those dollars go to law en@@ forc@@ ement and safety .
And I think that opportunity exists all around us .
CA : There &apos;s been this huge dec@@ line in crime in America over the last three decades .
And part of the narrative of that is sometimes that it &apos;s about increas@@ ed incar@@ cer@@ ation rates .
What would you say to someone who believed that ?
B@@ S : Well actually the violent crime rate has re@@ main@@ ed relatively stable .
The great increase in mass incar@@ cer@@ ation in this country wasn &apos;t really in violent crime categ@@ ories .
It was this mis@@ gu@@ ided war on drugs .
That &apos;s where the dram@@ atic increas@@ es have come in our prison population .
And we got car@@ ried away with the r@@ h@@ et@@ or@@ ic of pun@@ ish@@ ment .
And so we have three stri@@ kes laws that put people in prison forever for ste@@ aling a bic@@ y@@ cle , for low-@@ level property crimes , rather than making them give those resources back to the people who they victi@@ mi@@ zed .
I believe we need to do more to help people who are victi@@ mi@@ zed by crime , not do less .
And I think our current pun@@ ish@@ ment philosoph@@ y does nothing for no one .
And I think that &apos;s the ori@@ entation that we have to change .
CA : Br@@ y@@ an , you &apos;ve struc@@ k a massive ch@@ ord here .
You &apos;re an inspir@@ ing person .
Thank you so much for coming to TED . Thank you .

Oh , my God .
Peter Di@@ am@@ and@@ is : So those are just a few of the cli@@ ps I coll@@ ected over the last six months -- could have easily been the last six days or the last six years .
The point is that the news media pre@@ fer@@ enti@@ ally fe@@ eds us negative stories because that &apos;s what our minds pay attention to .
And there &apos;s a very good reason for that .
Every second of every day , our sen@@ ses bring in way too much data than we can possibly process in our brains .
And because nothing is more important to us than survival , the first stop of all of that data is an ancient sli@@ ver of the tempor@@ al lo@@ be called the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ ala .
Now the am@@ y@@ g@@ d@@ ala is our early war@@ ning det@@ ect@@ or , our danger det@@ ect@@ or .
It sorts and s@@ cou@@ rs through all of the information looking for anything in the environment that might har@@ m us .
So given a do@@ zen news stories , we will pre@@ fer@@ enti@@ ally look at the negative news .
And that old newsp@@ aper saying , &quot; If it ble@@ eds it leads , &quot; is very true .
So given all of our digital devices that are bringing all the negative news to us seven days a week , 24 hours a day , it &apos;s no wonder that we &apos;re pes@@ sim@@ istic .
It &apos;s no wonder that people think that the world is getting worse .
But perhaps that &apos;s not the case .
Per@@ haps instead , it &apos;s the dist@@ or@@ tions brought to us of what &apos;s really going on .
Per@@ haps the tremendous progress we &apos;ve made over the last century by a series of forces are , in fact , acceler@@ ating to a point that we have the potential in the next three decades to create a world of ab@@ un@@ dance .
Now I &apos;m not saying we don &apos;t have our set of problems -- climate crisis , species extinction , water and energy shor@@ t@@ age -- we su@@ rely do .
And as humans , we are far better at seeing the problems way in adv@@ ance , but ultimately we kno@@ ck them down .
So let &apos;s look at what this last century has been to see where we &apos;re going .
Over the last hundred years , the average human lif@@ esp@@ an has more than doubl@@ ed , average per capit@@ a income ad@@ just@@ ed for infl@@ ation around the world has tri@@ pl@@ ed .
Chil@@ d@@ hood mortality has come down a fac@@ tor of 10 .
Ad@@ d to that the cost of food , electricity , transport@@ ation , communication have dro@@ pped 10 to 1,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ fold .
Steve P@@ in@@ ker has showed us that , in fact , we &apos;re living during the most pe@@ ace@@ ful time ever in human history .
And Charles K@@ enn@@ y that global liter@@ acy has gone from 25 percent to over 80 percent in the last 1@@ 30 years .
We truly are living in an extraordinary time .
And many people forget this .
And we keep setting our expect@@ ations higher and higher .
In fact , we re@@ define what poverty means .
Think of this , in America today , the majority of people under the poverty line still have electricity , water , toil@@ ets , re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators , television , mobile phones , air condi@@ tioning and cars .
The we@@ al@@ thi@@ est rob@@ ber bar@@ ons of the last century , the em@@ per@@ ors on this planet , could have never dre@@ amed of such lux@@ u@@ ries .
Un@@ der@@ p@@ inning much of this is technology , and of late , exponenti@@ ally growing technologies .
My good friend R@@ ay K@@ ur@@ z@@ we@@ il showed that any tool that becomes an information technology ju@@ m@@ ps on this cur@@ ve , on Moore &apos;s La@@ w , and experiences price performance doubl@@ ing every 12 to 24 months .
That &apos;s why the cell@@ phone in your po@@ cket is literally a million times che@@ aper and a thousand times faster than a super@@ computer of the &apos; 7@@ 0s .
Now look at this cur@@ ve .
This is Moore &apos;s La@@ w over the last hundred years .
I want you to notice two things from this cur@@ ve .
Num@@ ber one , how smo@@ oth it is -- through good time and bad time , war time and peace time , rec@@ ession , depression and bo@@ om time .
This is the result of faster computers being used to build faster computers .
It doesn &apos;t slow for any of our grand challenges .
And also , even though it &apos;s pl@@ ot@@ ted on a lo@@ g cur@@ ve on the left , it &apos;s cur@@ ving up@@ wards .
The rate at which the technology is getting faster is itself getting faster .
And on this cur@@ ve , ri@@ ding on Moore &apos;s La@@ w , are a set of extraordin@@ arily powerful technologies available to all of us .
Cl@@ oud computing , what my friends at Au@@ to@@ des@@ k call infin@@ ite computing ; sens@@ ors and networks ; robo@@ tics ; 3D printing , which is the ability to demo@@ crati@@ ze and distribu@@ te person@@ alized production around the planet ; syn@@ thetic biology ; fu@@ els , vacc@@ ines and fo@@ ods ; digital medicine ; nan@@ om@@ at@@ er@@ i@@ als ; and A@@ .@@ I .
I mean , how many of you saw the win@@ ning of Je@@ opar@@ dy by I@@ B@@ M &apos;s Wat@@ son ?
I mean , that was epi@@ c .
In fact , I s@@ cou@@ red the head@@ lines looking for the best head@@ line in a newsp@@ aper I could .
And I love this : &quot; Wat@@ son V@@ an@@ qu@@ ish@@ es Hu@@ man O@@ p@@ pon@@ ents . &quot;
Je@@ opar@@ dy &apos;s not an easy game .
It &apos;s about the nu@@ ance of human language .
And imagine if you would A@@ .@@ I@@ . &apos; s like this on the cloud available to every person with a cell@@ phone .
F@@ our years ago here at TED , R@@ ay K@@ ur@@ z@@ we@@ il and I started a new university called Sing@@ ul@@ ar@@ ity University .
And we teach our students all of these technologies , and particularly how they can be used to solve humanity &apos;s grand challenges .
And every year we ask them to start a company or a product or a service that can affect posi@@ tively the lives of a billion people within a decade .
Think about that , the fact that , literally , a group of students can touch the lives of a billion people today .
30 years ago that would have sou@@ n@@ ded lu@@ di@@ cr@@ ous .
Today we can point at do@@ z@@ ens of companies that have done just that .
When I think about creating ab@@ un@@ dance , it &apos;s not about creating a life of lux@@ ury for everybody on this planet ; it &apos;s about creating a life of possibility .
It is about taking that which was scar@@ ce and making it ab@@ un@@ dant .
You see , scar@@ city is contex@@ tual , and technology is a res@@ our@@ ce@@ -@@ liber@@ ating force .
Let me give you an example .
So this is a story of N@@ apo@@ le@@ on I@@ II in the mi@@ d-@@ 18@@ 0@@ 0s .
He &apos;s the du@@ de on the left .
He invited over to dinner the king of Si@@ am .
All of N@@ apo@@ le@@ on &apos;s tro@@ ops were f@@ ed with sil@@ ver u@@ ten@@ s@@ ils , N@@ apo@@ le@@ on himself with gold u@@ ten@@ s@@ ils .
But the King of Si@@ am , he was f@@ ed with alu@@ minu@@ m u@@ ten@@ s@@ ils .
You see , alu@@ minu@@ m was the most valuable met@@ al on the planet , worth more than gold and plat@@ in@@ um .
It &apos;s the reason that the ti@@ p of the Washington Mon@@ u@@ ment is made of alu@@ minu@@ m .
You see , even though alu@@ minu@@ m is 8@@ .@@ 3 percent of the Earth by mass , it doesn &apos;t come as a pure met@@ al .
It &apos;s all b@@ ound by oxygen and si@@ lic@@ ates .
But then the technology of electr@@ ol@@ y@@ sis came along and literally made alu@@ minu@@ m so cheap that we use it with thro@@ w@@ -@@ away ment@@ ality .
So let &apos;s project this analo@@ g@@ y going forward .
We think about energy scar@@ city .
L@@ adi@@ es and gentlemen , we are on a planet that is b@@ ath@@ ed with 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year .
16 ter@@ aw@@ at@@ ts of energy h@@ its the Earth &apos;s surface every 8@@ 8 minutes .
It &apos;s not about being scar@@ ce , it &apos;s about accessi@@ bility .
And there &apos;s good news here .
For the first time , this year the cost of sol@@ ar@@ -@@ gener@@ ated electricity is 50 percent that of di@@ es@@ el@@ -@@ gener@@ ated electricity in India -- 8@@ .@@ 8 ru@@ pe@@ es versus 17 ru@@ pe@@ es .
The cost of solar dro@@ pped 50 percent last year .
Last month , MIT put out a study showing that by the end of this decade , in the sun@@ ny parts of the United States , solar electricity will be six cents a kil@@ o@@ wat@@ t hour compared to 15 cents as a national average .
And if we have ab@@ un@@ dant energy , we also have ab@@ un@@ dant water .
Now we talk about water w@@ ars .
Do you remember when Car@@ l S@@ ag@@ an turned the Vo@@ y@@ ager spac@@ ec@@ r@@ aft back towards the Earth , in 1990 after it just passed Satur@@ n ?
He took a famous photo . What was it called ?
&quot; A P@@ ale B@@ lue D@@ ot . &quot;
Because we live on a water planet .
We live on a planet 70 percent covered by water .
Yes , 9@@ 7@@ .@@ 5 percent is sal@@ tw@@ ater , two percent is ice , and we fight over a half a percent of the water on this planet , but here too there is hope .
And there is technology coming online , not 10 , 20 years from now , right now .
There &apos;s nan@@ otechno@@ logy coming on , nan@@ om@@ at@@ er@@ i@@ als .
And the conversation I had with De@@ an K@@ am@@ en this morning , one of the great D@@ I@@ Y innov@@ ators , I &apos;d like to share with you -- he gave me per@@ mission to do so -- his technology called S@@ l@@ ing@@ shot that many of you may have heard of , it is the size of a small dor@@ m room re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ator .
It &apos;s able to generate a thousand lit@@ ers of clean dr@@ inking water a day out of any source -- sal@@ tw@@ ater , pollu@@ ted water , la@@ tr@@ ine -- at less than two cents a lit@@ er .
The ch@@ air@@ man of C@@ oc@@ a-@@ Co@@ la has just agre@@ ed to do a major test of hundreds of un@@ its of this in the developing world .
And if that p@@ ans out , which I have every confidence it will , C@@ oc@@ a-@@ Co@@ la will depl@@ o@@ y this glob@@ ally to 20@@ 6 countries around the planet .
This is the kind of innovation , em@@ powered by this technology , that exists today .
And we &apos;ve seen this in cell@@ phones .
My go@@ od@@ ness , we &apos;re going to hit 70 percent pen@@ e@@ tr@@ ation of cell@@ phones in the developing world by the end of 20@@ 13 .
Think about it , that a Mas@@ ai w@@ arri@@ or on a cell@@ phone in the middle of Kenya has better mobile com@@ m than President Re@@ ag@@ an did 25 years ago .
And if they &apos;re on a smart@@ phone on Google , they &apos;ve got access to more knowledge and information than President Cl@@ int@@ on did 15 years ago .
They &apos;re living in a world of information and communication ab@@ un@@ dance that no one could have ever predic@@ ted .
B@@ et@@ ter than that , the things that you and I spent tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars for -- GPS , H@@ D video and still images , libr@@ aries of books and music , medical diagnostic technology -- are now literally dem@@ at@@ er@@ i@@ aliz@@ ing and demon@@ e@@ tiz@@ ing into your cell@@ phone .
P@@ rob@@ ably the best part of it is what &apos;s coming down the pi@@ ke in health .
Last month , I had the plea@@ sure of announc@@ ing with Qu@@ al@@ com@@ m F@@ oundation something called the $ 10 million Qu@@ al@@ com@@ m T@@ ri@@ cor@@ der X Pri@@ ze .
We &apos;re challeng@@ ing te@@ ams around the world to basically combine these technologies into a mobile device that you can speak to , because it &apos;s got A@@ .@@ I@@ . , you can cou@@ gh on it , you can do a finger blood pr@@ ick .
And to win , it needs to be able to diagno@@ se you better than a team of bo@@ ar@@ d-@@ cer@@ ti@@ fied doctors .
So literally , imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors , 25 percent of the disease bur@@ den and 1.@@ 3 percent of the health care workers .
When this device se@@ quences an R@@ NA or DNA virus that it doesn &apos;t recognize , it calls the C@@ D@@ C and prev@@ ents the p@@ and@@ em@@ ic from happening in the first place .
But here , here is the biggest force for bringing about a world of ab@@ un@@ dance .
I call it the ris@@ ing billion .
So the white lines here are population .
We just passed the seven billion mark on Earth .
And by the way , the biggest protection against a population explosion is making the world educ@@ ated and healthy .
In 2010 , we had just short of two billion people online , connected .
By 20@@ 20 , that &apos;s going from two billion to five billion Internet users .
Three billion new minds who have never been heard from before are connec@@ ting to the global conversation .
What will these people want ?
What will they consu@@ me ? What will they desire ?
And rather than having economic sh@@ ut@@ down , we &apos;re about to have the biggest economic inj@@ ection ever .
These people represent tens of trilli@@ ons of dollars inj@@ ected into the global economy .
And they will get health@@ ier by using the T@@ ri@@ cor@@ der , and they &apos;ll become better educ@@ ated by using the K@@ h@@ an Ac@@ adem@@ y , and by literally being able to use 3D printing and infin@@ ite computing &#91; become &#93; more productive than ever before .
So what could three billion ris@@ ing , healthy , educ@@ ated , productive members of humanity bring to us ?
How about a set of voices that have never been heard from before .
What about giving the op@@ pressed , wh@@ er@@ ever they might be , the voice to be heard and the voice to act for the first time ever ?
What will these three billion people bring ?
What about contribu@@ tions we can &apos;t even predict ?
The one thing I &apos;ve learned at the X Pri@@ ze is that small te@@ ams driven by their passion with a clear focus can do extraordinary things , things that large corpor@@ ations and governments could only do in the past .
Let me share and close with a story that really got me excited .
There is a program that some of you might have heard of .
It &apos;s a game called F@@ ol@@ dit .
It came out of the University of Washington in Se@@ at@@ tle .
And this is a game where individuals can actually take a sequence of amin@@ o aci@@ ds and figure out how the protein is going to fold .
And how it fol@@ ds dic@@ tat@@ es its structure and its func@@ tion@@ ality .
And it &apos;s very important for research in medicine .
And up until now , it &apos;s been a super@@ computer problem .
And this game has been played by university profess@@ ors and so forth .
And it &apos;s literally , hundreds of thousands of people came online and started playing it .
And it showed that , in fact , today , the human pattern recogni@@ tion mach@@ in@@ ery is better at fol@@ ding prot@@ e@@ ins than the best computers .
And when these individuals went and looked at who was the best protein fol@@ der in the world , it wasn &apos;t an MIT professor , it wasn &apos;t a Cal@@ T@@ ech student , it was a person from England , from Man@@ ches@@ ter , a woman who , during the day , was an ex@@ ecu@@ tive ass@@ istant at a re@@ h@@ ab clin@@ ic and , at night , was the world &apos;s best protein fol@@ der .
L@@ adi@@ es and gentlemen , what gives me tremendous confidence in the future is the fact that we are now more em@@ powered as individuals to take on the grand challenges of this planet .
We have the tools with this exponenti@@ al technology .
We have the passion of the D@@ I@@ Y innov@@ ator .
We have the capital of the techno@@ -@@ philanthro@@ p@@ ist .
And we have three billion new minds coming online to work with us to solve the grand challenges , to do that which we must do .
We are living into extraordinary decades ahead .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to speak about a tiny , little idea .
And this is about shif@@ ting bas@@ el@@ ine .
And because the idea can be expl@@ ained in one minute , I will tell you three stories before to fill in the time .
And the first story is about Charles Darwin , one of my her@@ oes .
And he was here , as you well know , in &apos; 35 .
And you &apos;d think he was ch@@ as@@ ing fin@@ ches , but he wasn &apos;t .
He was actually collec@@ ting fish .
And he described one of them as very &quot; common . &quot;
This was the s@@ ail@@ fin grou@@ per .
A big fish@@ ery was run on it until the &apos; 8@@ 0s .
Now the fish is on the I@@ U@@ C@@ N R@@ ed L@@ ist .
Now this story , we have heard it lots of times on Gal@@ ap@@ ag@@ os and other places , so there is nothing particular about it .
But the point is , we still come to Gal@@ ap@@ ag@@ os .
We still think it is pr@@ ist@@ ine .
The bro@@ chu@@ res still say it is un@@ tou@@ ched .
So what happens here ?
The second story , also to illustr@@ ate another concept , is called shif@@ ting wai@@ st@@ line .
Because I was there in &apos; 7@@ 1 , studying a l@@ ag@@ o@@ on in West Africa .
I was there because I grew up in Europe and I wanted later to work in Africa .
And I thought I could bl@@ end in .
And I got a big sun@@ bur@@ n , and I was convinced that I was really not from there .
This was my first sun@@ bur@@ n .
And the l@@ ag@@ o@@ on was surr@@ ounded by pal@@ m trees , as you can see , and a few mang@@ ro@@ ve .
And it had til@@ ap@@ ia about 20 centi@@ meters , a species of til@@ ap@@ ia called bl@@ ack@@ ch@@ in til@@ ap@@ ia .
And the fish@@ eries for this til@@ ap@@ ia sust@@ ained lots of fish and they had a good time and they ear@@ ned more than average in Ghana .
When I went there 27 years later , the fish had sh@@ run@@ k to half of their size .
They were m@@ atu@@ ring at five centi@@ meters .
They had been push@@ ed gene@@ tically .
There were still fish@@ es .
They were still kind of happy .
And the fish also were happy to be there .
So nothing has changed , but everything has changed .
My third little story is that I was an ac@@ compli@@ ce in the intro@@ duction of tra@@ w@@ ling in Sou@@ the@@ ast Asia .
In the &apos; 7@@ 0s -- well , beginning in the &apos; 6@@ 0s -- Europe did lots of development projects .
F@@ ish development meant im@@ pos@@ ing on countries that had already 100,000 fish@@ ers to im@@ pose on them industrial fishing .
And this boat , quite u@@ g@@ ly , is called the M@@ uti@@ ar@@ a 4 .
And I went s@@ ail@@ ing on it , and we did sur@@ ve@@ ys throughout the sou@@ thern South China sea and especially the J@@ av@@ a Se@@ a .
And what we caught , we didn &apos;t have words for it .
What we caught , I know now , is the bottom of the sea .
And 90 percent of our catch were spon@@ ges , other animals that are fix@@ ed on the bottom .
And actually most of the fish , they are a little spot on the de@@ br@@ is , the pi@@ les of de@@ br@@ is , were coral re@@ ef fish .
Ess@@ enti@@ ally the bottom of the sea came onto the dec@@ k and then was thro@@ wn down .
And these pictures are extraordinary because this transition is very rap@@ id .
Wi@@ thin a year , you do a sur@@ vey and then commercial fishing begins .
The bottom is transform@@ ed from , in this case , a hard bottom or soft coral into a mu@@ d@@ dy m@@ ess .
This is a dead tur@@ tle .
They were not e@@ at@@ en , they were thro@@ wn away because they were dead .
And one time we caught a live one .
It was not dro@@ w@@ ned yet .
And then they wanted to kill it because it was good to eat .
This mountain of de@@ br@@ is is actually coll@@ ected by fish@@ ers every time they go into an area that &apos;s never been f@@ ished .
But it &apos;s not document@@ ed .
We transform the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
We ad@@ just our bas@@ el@@ ine to the new level , and we don &apos;t rec@@ all what was there .
If you gener@@ alize this , something like this happens .
You have on the y ax@@ is some good thing : bio@@ diversity , numbers of or@@ ca , the green@@ ness of your country , the water supply .
And over time it changes -- it changes because people do things , or natur@@ ally .
Every generation will use the images that they got at the beginning of their conscious lives as a standard and will extra@@ pol@@ ate forward .
And the difference then , they perce@@ ive as a loss .
But they don &apos;t perce@@ ive what happened before as a loss .
You can have a succ@@ ession of changes .
At the end you want to sust@@ ain mis@@ er@@ able le@@ f@@ to@@ vers .
And that , to a large ex@@ tent , is what we want to do now .
We want to sust@@ ain things that are gone or things that are not the way they were .
Now one should think this problem affected people certainly when in pre@@ dat@@ ory societies , they killed animals and they didn &apos;t know they had done so after a few generations .
Because , obviously , an animal that is very ab@@ un@@ dant , before it gets extinc@@ t , it becomes rare .
So you don &apos;t lose ab@@ un@@ dant animals .
You always lose rare animals .
And therefore they &apos;re not perce@@ ived as a big loss .
Over time , we concentr@@ ate on large animals , and in a sea that means the big fish .
They become rar@@ er because we fish them .
Over time we have a few fish left and we think this is the bas@@ el@@ ine .
And the question is , why do people accept this ?
Well because they don &apos;t know that it was different .
And in fact , lots of people , scientists , will cont@@ est that it was really different .
And they will cont@@ est this because the evidence pres@@ ented in an earlier mode is not in the way they would like the evidence pres@@ ented .
For example , the an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote that some present , as Cap@@ t@@ ain so@@ -@@ and-@@ so obser@@ ved lots of fish in this area cannot be used or is usually not uti@@ li@@ zed by fish@@ ery scientists , because it &apos;s not &quot; scientific . &quot;
So you have a situation where people don &apos;t know the past , even though we live in liter@@ ate societies , because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
And h@@ ence , the enormous role that a marine protected area can play .
Because with marine protected areas , we actually re@@ create the past .
We re@@ create the past that people cannot con@@ ce@@ ive because the bas@@ el@@ ine has shif@@ ted and is extremely low .
That is for people who can see a marine protected area and who can benefit from the insi@@ ght that it provi@@ des , which en@@ ables them to res@@ et their bas@@ el@@ ine .
How about the people who can &apos;t do that because they have no access -- the people in the Mid@@ west for example ?
There I think that the arts and film can perhaps fill the gap , and simulation .
This is a simulation of Ch@@ es@@ ap@@ ea@@ ke Bay .
There were gr@@ ay wh@@ ales in Ch@@ es@@ ap@@ ea@@ ke Bay a long time ago -- 500 years ago .
And you will have noticed that the hu@@ es and t@@ ones are like &quot; Av@@ at@@ ar . &quot;
And if you think about &quot; Av@@ at@@ ar , &quot; if you think of why people were so tou@@ ched by it -- never mind the P@@ oc@@ a@@ hon@@ t@@ as story -- why so tou@@ ched by the imag@@ ery ?
Because it ev@@ o@@ kes something that in a sense has been lost .
And so my re@@ comm@@ end@@ ation , it &apos;s the only one I will provide , is for Cam@@ er@@ on to do &quot; Av@@ at@@ ar II &quot; underwater .
Thank you very much .
H@@ i . I &apos;m K@@ evin Al@@ loc@@ ca , I &apos;m the tr@@ ends man@@ ager at YouTube , and I professi@@ on@@ ally watch YouTube videos .
It &apos;s true .
So we &apos;re going to talk a little bit today about how videos go vir@@ al and then why that even matters .
We all want to be stars -- cel@@ e@@ bri@@ ties , sing@@ ers , com@@ e@@ di@@ ans -- and when I was youn@@ ger , that seemed so very , very hard to do .
But now Web video has made it so that any of us or any of the creative things that we do can become completely famous in a part of our world &apos;s culture .
An@@ y one of you could be famous on the Internet by next Satur@@ day .
But there are over 4@@ 8 hours of video u@@ pl@@ o@@ aded to YouTube every minute .
And of that , only a tiny per@@ centage ever goes vir@@ al and gets tons of vie@@ ws and becomes a cultural moment .
So how does it happen ?
Three things : tas@@ tem@@ ak@@ ers , communities of participation and un@@ exp@@ ec@@ te@@ d@@ ness .
All right , let &apos;s go .
B@@ ear V@@ as@@ quez : Oh , my God . Oh , my God .
Oh , my God !
W@@ oo@@ o !
O@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h , w@@ ow@@ w@@ w@@ w !
K@@ A : Last year , B@@ ear V@@ as@@ quez pos@@ ted this video that he had shot outside his home in Y@@ o@@ sem@@ ite National Park .
In 2010 , it was vie@@ wed 23 million times .
This is a ch@@ art of what it looked like when it first became popular last summer .
But he didn &apos;t actually set out to make a vir@@ al video , B@@ ear .
He just wanted to share a rain@@ b@@ ow .
Because that &apos;s what you do when your name is Y@@ o@@ sem@@ ite M@@ ount@@ ain B@@ ear .
And he had pos@@ ted lots of nature videos in fact .
And this video had actually been pos@@ ted all the way back in Jan@@ u@@ ary .
So what happened here ?
J@@ im@@ my K@@ imm@@ el actually .
J@@ im@@ my K@@ imm@@ el pos@@ ted this twe@@ et that would eventually pro@@ pe@@ l the video to be as popular as it would become .
Because tas@@ tem@@ ak@@ ers like J@@ im@@ my K@@ imm@@ el introduce us to new and interesting things and bring them to a larger audience .
Re@@ bec@@ ca B@@ lack : ♫ It &apos;s Fri@@ day , Fri@@ day . G@@ ot@@ ta get down on Fri@@ day . ♫ ♫ Everybody &apos;s looking forward to the wee@@ k@@ end , wee@@ k@@ end . ♫ ♫ Fri@@ day , Fri@@ day . G@@ et@@ tin &apos; down on Fri@@ day . ♫ K@@ A : So you didn &apos;t think that we could actually have this conversation without talking about this video I hope .
Re@@ bec@@ ca B@@ lack &apos;s &quot; Fri@@ day &quot; is one of the most popular videos of the year .
It &apos;s been seen nearly 200 million times this year .
This is a ch@@ art of what it looked like .
And similar to &quot; D@@ ou@@ ble R@@ ain@@ b@@ ow , &quot; it seems to have just spr@@ ou@@ ted up out of no@@ where .
So what happened on this day ?
Well it was a Fri@@ day , this is true .
And if you &apos;re wondering about those other spi@@ kes , those are also Fri@@ days .
But what about this day , this one particular Fri@@ day ?
Well To@@ sh@@ .@@ 0 picked it up , a lot of blogs starting writing about .
Michael J@@ . N@@ el@@ son from My@@ st@@ ery Science The@@ ater was one of the first people to pos@@ t a jo@@ ke about the video on Twitter .
But what &apos;s important is that an individual or a group of tas@@ tem@@ ak@@ ers took a point of view and they shared that with a larger audience , acceler@@ ating the process .
And so then this community formed of people who shared this big inside jo@@ ke and they started talking about it and doing things with it .
And now there are 10,000 par@@ o@@ dies of &quot; Fri@@ day &quot; on YouTube .
Even in the first seven days , there was one par@@ o@@ dy for every other day of the week .
Un@@ like the one-@@ way entert@@ ain@@ ment of the 20th century , this community participation is how we become a part of the phenomenon -- either by sp@@ reading it or by doing something new with it .
So &quot; N@@ y@@ an C@@ at &quot; is a lo@@ op@@ ed animation with lo@@ op@@ ed music .
It &apos;s this , just like this .
It &apos;s been vie@@ wed nearly 50 million times this year .
And if you think that that is weird , you should know that there is a three-@@ hour version of this that &apos;s been vie@@ wed four million times .
Even c@@ ats were watching this video .
C@@ ats were watching other c@@ ats watch this video .
But what &apos;s important here is the creativity that it inspired am@@ ong@@ st this tech@@ ie , ge@@ e@@ ky Internet culture .
There were remi@@ x@@ es .
Some@@ one made an old ti@@ me@@ y version .
And then it went international .
An entire remi@@ x community spr@@ ou@@ ted up that brought it from being just a stupid jo@@ ke to something that we can all actually be a part of .
Because we don &apos;t just enjoy now , we particip@@ ate .
And who could have predic@@ ted any of this ?
Who could have predic@@ ted &quot; D@@ ou@@ ble R@@ ain@@ b@@ ow &quot; or Re@@ bec@@ ca B@@ lack or &quot; N@@ y@@ an C@@ at ? &quot;
What s@@ crip@@ ts could you have written that would have cont@@ ained this in it ?
In a world where over two days of video get u@@ pl@@ o@@ aded every minute , only that which is truly unique and un@@ expected can stand out in the way that these things have .
When a friend of mine told me that I needed to see this great video about a guy prot@@ esting bic@@ y@@ cle fin@@ es in New York City , I ad@@ mit I wasn &apos;t very interested .
C@@ as@@ ey Ni@@ est@@ at : So I got a tic@@ ket for not ri@@ ding in the bi@@ ke lan@@ e , but often there are ob@@ struc@@ tions that keep you from proper@@ ly ri@@ ding in the bi@@ ke lan@@ e .
K@@ A : By being totally surprising and hu@@ mor@@ ous , C@@ as@@ ey Ni@@ est@@ at got his funny idea and point seen five million times .
And so this approach hol@@ ds for anything new that we do cre@@ atively .
And so it all brings us to one big question ...
B@@ ear V@@ as@@ quez : What does this mean ?
O@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h .
K@@ A : What does it mean ?
Tas@@ tem@@ ak@@ ers , creative particip@@ ating communities , complete un@@ exp@@ ec@@ te@@ d@@ ness , these are character@@ is@@ tics of a new kind of media and a new kind of culture where anyone has access and the audience defin@@ es the popul@@ ar@@ ity .
I mean , as mentioned earlier , one of the biggest stars in the world right now , Jus@@ tin Bi@@ e@@ ber , got his start on YouTube .
No one has to gre@@ en-@@ light your idea .
And we all now feel some ow@@ ner@@ ship in our own pop culture .
And these are not character@@ is@@ tics of old media , and they &apos;re bar@@ ely true of the media of today , but they will define the entert@@ ain@@ ment of the future .
Thank you .
How can I speak in 10 minutes about the bon@@ ds of women over three generations , about how the as@@ ton@@ ishing strength of those bon@@ ds took hold in the life of a four@@ -year-old girl hu@@ dd@@ led with her young sister , her mother and her grandmother for five days and ni@@ ghts in a small boat in the China Se@@ a more than 30 years ago , bon@@ ds that took hold in the life of that small girl
and never let go -- that small girl now living in San Francisco and speaking to you today ?
This is not a finished story .
It is a j@@ ig@@ saw puzzle still being put together .
Let me tell you about some of the pieces .
Imagine the first piece : a man bur@@ ning his life &apos;s work .
He is a po@@ et , a play@@ w@@ right , a man whose whole life had been bal@@ anced on the single hope of his country &apos;s un@@ ity and freedom .
Imagine him as the commun@@ ists enter S@@ ai@@ g@@ on , confron@@ ting the fact that his life had been a complete waste .
Wor@@ ds , for so long his friends , now mo@@ c@@ ked him .
He re@@ treated into silence .
He died broken by history .
He is my grand@@ father .
I never knew him in real life .
But our lives are much more than our mem@@ ories .
My grandmother never let me forget his life .
My du@@ ty was not to allow it to have been in v@@ ain , and my lesson was to learn that , yes , history tried to cr@@ ush us , but we end@@ u@@ red .
The next piece of the j@@ ig@@ saw is of a boat in the early d@@ a@@ wn sli@@ pping sil@@ ently out to sea .
My mother , M@@ ai , was 18 when her father died -- already in an arrang@@ ed marriage , already with two small girls .
For her , life had dis@@ til@@ led itself into one task : the es@@ cape of her family and a new life in Australia .
It was in@@ con@@ ce@@ iv@@ able to her that she would not succe@@ ed .
So after a four@@ -@@ year s@@ ag@@ a that de@@ fi@@ es fiction , a boat sli@@ pped out to sea dis@@ gu@@ is@@ ed as a fishing v@@ es@@ sel .
All the adults knew the risks .
The greatest fear was of pir@@ ates , rap@@ e and death .
Like most adults on the boat , my mother car@@ ried a small bot@@ tle of pois@@ on .
If we were cap@@ tured , first my sister and I , then she and my grandmother would drink .
My first mem@@ ories are from the boat -- the stea@@ dy beat of the engine , the b@@ ow di@@ pping into each wave , the vast and empty horiz@@ on .
I don &apos;t remember the pir@@ ates who came many times , but were blu@@ ff@@ ed by the br@@ av@@ a@@ do of the men on our boat , or the engine dying and fai@@ ling to start for six hours .
But I do remember the lights on the oil ri@@ g off the Mal@@ ay@@ sian coast and the young man who collap@@ sed and died , the journey &apos;s end too much for him , and the first app@@ le I tas@@ ted , given to me by the men on the ri@@ g .
No app@@ le has ever tas@@ ted the same .
After three months in a refuge@@ e camp , we land@@ ed in M@@ el@@ bour@@ ne .
And the next piece of the j@@ ig@@ saw is about four women across three generations shap@@ ing a new life together .
We sett@@ led in F@@ o@@ ot@@ scr@@ ay , a work@@ ing-@@ class su@@ bur@@ b whose dem@@ ographic is lay@@ ers of im@@ migr@@ ants .
Un@@ like the sett@@ led midd@@ le-@@ class su@@ bur@@ bs , whose existence I was ob@@ li@@ vi@@ ous of , there was no sense of enti@@ t@@ lement in F@@ o@@ ot@@ scr@@ ay .
The sm@@ el@@ ls from shop do@@ ors were from the rest of the world .
And the s@@ ni@@ p@@ pe@@ ts of hal@@ ting English were ex@@ changed between people who had one thing in common , they were starting again .
My mother worked on far@@ ms , then on a car ass@@ em@@ bly line , working six days , double shif@@ ts .
Some@@ how she found time to study English and gain IT quali@@ fic@@ ations .
We were poor .
All the dollars were al@@ loc@@ ated and extra tu@@ ition in English and mathematics was bud@@ get@@ ed for regard@@ less of what miss@@ ed out , which was usually new clo@@ thes ; they were always second@@ hand .
Two pairs of stoc@@ k@@ ings for school , each to hide the holes in the other .
A school uni@@ form down to the ank@@ les , because it had to last for six years .
And there were rare but sear@@ ing ch@@ ants of &quot; s@@ lit@@ -@@ eye &quot; and the occas@@ i@@ onal gr@@ aff@@ it@@ i : &quot; A@@ sian , go home . &quot;
Go home to where ?
Some@@ thing sti@@ ff@@ en@@ ed inside me .
There was a gath@@ ering of resol@@ ve and a qui@@ et voice saying , &quot; I will by@@ pass you . &quot;
My mother , my sister and I sle@@ pt in the same bed .
My mother was ex@@ hau@@ st@@ ed each night , but we told one another about our day and listen@@ ed to the movements of my grandmother around the house .
My mother suff@@ ered from ni@@ ght@@ mar@@ es all about the boat .
And my job was to stay aw@@ ake until her ni@@ ght@@ mar@@ es came so I could wake her .
She opened a computer store then studied to be a beauti@@ ci@@ an and opened another business .
And the women came with their stories about men who could not make the transition , an@@ gry and in@@ flex@@ ible , and trou@@ bl@@ ed children caught between two worlds .
Gr@@ ants and spon@@ s@@ ors were sou@@ ght .
C@@ ent@@ ers were establ@@ ished .
I lived in par@@ alle@@ l worlds .
In one , I was the classi@@ c A@@ sian student , rel@@ ent@@ less in the dem@@ ands that I made on myself .
In the other , I was en@@ mes@@ h@@ ed in lives that were pre@@ car@@ ious , trag@@ ically scar@@ red by violence , drug ab@@ use and isol@@ ation .
But so many over the years were helped .
And for that work , when I was a final year law student , I was cho@@ sen as the young Australi@@ an of the year .
And I was cat@@ ap@@ ul@@ ted from one piece of the j@@ ig@@ saw to another , and their ed@@ ges didn &apos;t fit .
T@@ an Le , anony@@ m@@ ous F@@ o@@ ot@@ scr@@ ay res@@ ident , was now T@@ an Le , refuge@@ e and social activis@@ t , invited to speak in ven@@ ues she had never heard of and into homes whose existence she could never have imagin@@ ed .
I didn &apos;t know the prot@@ oc@@ ols .
I didn &apos;t know how to use the cut@@ l@@ ery .
I didn &apos;t know how to talk about w@@ ine .
I didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
I wanted to re@@ treat to the rout@@ ines and com@@ fort of life in an un@@ sun@@ g su@@ bur@@ b -- a grandmother , a mother and two dau@@ gh@@ ters ending each day as they had for almost 20 years , telling one another the story of their day and fall@@ ing as@@ le@@ ep , the three of us still in the same bed .
I told my mother I couldn &apos;t do it .
She re@@ min@@ ded me that I was now the same age she had been when we bo@@ ar@@ ded the boat .
No had never been an option .
&quot; Just do it , &quot; she said , &quot; and don &apos;t be what you &apos;re not . &quot;
So I spoke out on y@@ ou@@ th un@@ employ@@ ment and education and the ne@@ gl@@ ect of the mar@@ gin@@ alized and the dis@@ en@@ fran@@ ch@@ is@@ ed .
And the more candi@@ dly I spoke , the more I was asked to speak .
I met people from all wal@@ ks of life , so many of them doing the thing they loved , living on the fronti@@ ers of possibility .
And even though I finished my degree , I realized I could not set@@ tle into a career in law .
There had to be another piece of the j@@ ig@@ saw .
And I realized at the same time that it is okay to be an out@@ si@@ der , a recent arriv@@ al , new on the scene -- and not just okay , but something to be th@@ ank@@ ful for , perhaps a gi@@ ft from the boat .
Because being an insi@@ der can so easily mean collap@@ sing the horiz@@ ons , can so easily mean accep@@ ting the pres@@ u@@ mp@@ tions of your pro@@ v@@ ince .
I have ste@@ pped outside my com@@ fort zone enough now to know that , yes , the world does fall apart , but not in the way that you fear .
P@@ os@@ si@@ bilities that would not have been allowed were ou@@ tr@@ age@@ ously encour@@ aged .
There was an energy there , an im@@ plac@@ able optimis@@ m , a strange mix@@ ture of hum@@ il@@ ity and dar@@ ing .
So I followed my hun@@ ches .
I gath@@ ered around me a small team of people for whom the lab@@ el &quot; It can &apos;t be done &quot; was an ir@@ res@@ is@@ tible challenge .
For a year we were pen@@ n@@ il@@ ess .
At the end of each day , I made a huge po@@ t of sou@@ p which we all shared .
We worked well into each night .
Most of our ideas were crazy , but a few were brilliant , and we broke through .
I made the decision to move to the U.@@ S .
after only one trip .
My hun@@ ches again .
Three months later I had re@@ loc@@ ated , and the ad@@ venture has continu@@ ed .
Be@@ fore I close though , let me tell you about my grandmother .
She grew up at a time when Con@@ fu@@ ci@@ an@@ ism was the social nor@@ m and the local Mand@@ ar@@ in was the person who mat@@ tered .
Life hadn &apos;t changed for centu@@ ries .
Her father died soon after she was born .
Her mother raised her alone .
At 17 she became the second wife of a Mand@@ ar@@ in whose mother beat her .
With no support from her husband , she caused a sensation by taking him to court and pro@@ sec@@ u@@ ting her own case , and a far greater sensation when she won .
&quot; It can &apos;t be done &quot; was shown to be wrong .
I was taking a sho@@ wer in a hot@@ el room in Sy@@ d@@ ney the moment she died 600 miles away in M@@ el@@ bour@@ ne .
I looked through the sho@@ wer screen and saw her standing on the other side .
I knew she had come to say go@@ od@@ by@@ e .
My mother ph@@ oned minutes later .
A few days later , we went to a Bu@@ dd@@ his@@ t temp@@ le in F@@ o@@ ot@@ scr@@ ay and sat around her cas@@ ket .
We told her stories and assu@@ red her that we were still with her .
At mid@@ night the mon@@ k came and told us he had to close the cas@@ ket .
My mother asked us to feel her hand .
She asked the mon@@ k , &quot; Why is it that her hand is so warm and the rest of her is so cold ? &quot;
&quot; Because you have been holding it since this morning , &quot; he said .
&quot; You have not let it go . &quot;
If there is a sin@@ ew in our family , it r@@ uns through the women .
G@@ iv@@ en who we were and how life had shap@@ ed us , we can now see that the men who might have come into our lives would have th@@ war@@ ted us .
De@@ fe@@ at would have come too easily .
Now I would like to have my own children , and I wonder about the boat .
Who could ever wish it on their own ?
Yet I am afraid of privil@@ e@@ ge , of ease , of enti@@ t@@ lement .
Can I give them a b@@ ow in their lives , di@@ pping br@@ av@@ ely into each wave , the un@@ per@@ tur@@ bed and stea@@ dy beat of the engine , the vast horiz@@ on that gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ es nothing ?
I don &apos;t know .
But if I could give it and still see them saf@@ ely through , I would .
Tre@@ v@@ or Ne@@ il@@ son : And also , T@@ an &apos;s mother is here today in the fourth or fi@@ f@@ th row .
My story begins right here actually in R@@ aj@@ as@@ than about two years ago .
I was in the desert , under the star@@ ry sk@@ ies with the Su@@ f@@ i sing@@ er Mu@@ k@@ h@@ ti@@ ar Al@@ i .
And we were in conversation about how nothing had changed since the time of the ancient Indian epi@@ c &quot; The Ma@@ hab@@ har@@ ata . &quot;
So back in the day , when us Indi@@ ans wanted to travel we &apos;d jump into a ch@@ ari@@ ot and we &apos;d zo@@ om across the sky .
Now we do the same with air@@ plan@@ es .
B@@ ack then , when Ar@@ jun@@ a , the great Indian w@@ arri@@ or prin@@ ce , when he was thir@@ st@@ y , he &apos;d take out a b@@ ow , he &apos;d sho@@ ot it into the ground and water would come out .
Now we do the same with dr@@ ills and machines .
The conclusion that we came to was that magic had been re@@ placed by mach@@ in@@ ery .
And this made me really sad .
I found myself becoming a little bit of a techno@@ pho@@ be .
I was terri@@ fied by this idea that I would lose the ability to enjoy and appreci@@ ate the sun@@ set without having my camera on me , without twe@@ eting it to my friends .
And it felt like technology should en@@ able magic , not kill it .
When I was a little girl , my grand@@ father gave me his little sil@@ ver po@@ cket watch .
And this piece of 5@@ 0-@@ year-old technology became the most mag@@ ical thing to me .
It became a g@@ il@@ ded g@@ at@@ e@@ way into a world full of pir@@ ates and shi@@ p@@ w@@ rec@@ ks and images in my imagination .
So I felt like our cell@@ phones and our f@@ ancy wat@@ ches and our cameras had stopped us from dre@@ aming .
They stopped us from being inspired .
And so I ju@@ mp@@ ed in , I ju@@ mp@@ ed into this world of technology , to see how I could use it to en@@ able magic as op@@ posed to kill it .
I &apos;ve been illustr@@ ating books since I was 16 .
And so when I saw the iP@@ ad , I saw it as a stor@@ y@@ telling device that could connect read@@ ers all over the world .
It can know how we &apos;re holding it .
It can know where we are .
It brings together image and text and animation and sound and touch .
St@@ or@@ y@@ telling is becoming more and more multi-@@ sensor@@ ial .
But what are we doing with it ?
So I &apos;m actually just going to go in and laun@@ ch K@@ ho@@ ya , an inter@@ active ap@@ p for the iP@@ ad .
So it says , &quot; Pl@@ ace your fin@@ gers upon each light . &quot;
And so -- It says , &quot; This box bel@@ on@@ gs to ... &quot; And so I type in my name .
And actually I become a character in the book .
At various points , a little letter dro@@ ps down to me -- and the iP@@ ad knows where you live because of GPS -- which is actually ad@@ dr@@ essed to me .
The child in me is really excited by these kinds of possibilities .
Now I &apos;ve been talking a lot about magic .
And I don &apos;t mean w@@ iz@@ ards and drag@@ ons , I mean the kind of childhood magic , those ideas that we all har@@ bo@@ red as children .
This idea of fi@@ ref@@ lies in a j@@ ar , for some reason , was always really exciting to me .
And so over here you need to til@@ t your iP@@ ad , take the fi@@ ref@@ lies out .
And they actually illu@@ min@@ ate your way through the rest of the book .
Another idea that really fascin@@ ated me as a child was that an entire galaxy could be cont@@ ained within a single mar@@ ble .
And so over here , each book and each world becomes a little mar@@ ble that I dra@@ g in to this mag@@ ical device within the device .
And it op@@ ens up a map .
All along , all fantas@@ y books have always had maps , but these maps have been st@@ atic .
This is a map that gro@@ ws and glo@@ ws and becomes your navig@@ ation for the rest of the book .
It reve@@ als itself to you at certain points in the book as well .
So I &apos;m just going to enter in .
Another thing that &apos;s actually really important to me is creating content that is Indian and yet very contempor@@ ary .
Over here , these are the Ap@@ s@@ ar@@ as .
So we &apos;ve all heard about fai@@ ries and we &apos;ve all heard about n@@ y@@ m@@ ph@@ s , but how many people outside of India know about their Indian counter@@ parts , the Ap@@ s@@ ar@@ as ?
These poor Ap@@ s@@ ar@@ as have been tr@@ apped inside In@@ dr@@ a &apos;s cham@@ bers for thousands of years in an old and mu@@ st@@ y book .
And so we &apos;re bringing them back in a contempor@@ ary story for children .
And a story that actually de@@ als with new issues like the environmental crisis .
S@@ pea@@ king of the environmental crisis , I think a big problem has been in the last 10 years is that children have been loc@@ ked inside their rooms , glu@@ ed to their P@@ C@@ s , they haven &apos;t been able to get out .
But now with mobile technology , we can actually take our children outside into the natural world with their technology .
One of the interactions in the book is that you &apos;re sent off on this qu@@ est where you need to go outside , take out your camera on the iP@@ ad and collect pictures of different natural objects .
When I was a child , I had multiple collec@@ tions of stic@@ ks and st@@ ones and pe@@ b@@ bles and shel@@ ls .
And somehow kids don &apos;t do that anymore .
So in bringing back this childhood ritu@@ al , you need to go out and , in one chap@@ ter , take a picture of a flo@@ wer and then ta@@ g it .
In another chap@@ ter , you need to take a picture of a piece of bar@@ k and then ta@@ g that .
And what happens is that you actually create a digital collection of photograph@@ s that you can then put up online .
A child in London puts up a picture of a fo@@ x and says , &quot; Oh , I saw a fo@@ x today . &quot;
A child in India says , &quot; I saw a mon@@ key today . &quot;
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photograph@@ s that you &apos;ve actually taken .
In the possibilities of lin@@ king together magic , the earth and technology , there are multiple possibilities .
In the next book , we plan on having an interaction where you take your iP@@ ad out with the video on and through augment@@ ed reality , you see this layer of anim@@ ated pi@@ x@@ ies appear on a hou@@ se@@ plant that &apos;s outside your house .
At one point , your screen is filled up with leaves .
And so you need to make the sound of wind and b@@ low them away and read the rest of the book .
We &apos;re moving , we &apos;re all moving here , to a world where the forces of nature come closer together to technology , and magic and technology can come closer together .
We &apos;re har@@ n@@ essing energy from the sun .
We &apos;re bringing our children and ourselves closer to the natural world and that magic and joy and childhood love that we had through the simple medi@@ um of a story .
Thank you .
I would like to talk to you about why many e-@@ health projects fail .
And I really think that the most important thing of it is that we stopped listening to patients .
And one of the things we did at R@@ ad@@ bou@@ d University is we ap@@ poin@@ ted a chi@@ ef listening off@@ ic@@ er .
Not in a very scientific way -- she puts up a little cu@@ p of coffee or cu@@ p of te@@ a and asks patients , family , rel@@ atives , &quot; What &apos;s up ?
How could we help you ? &quot;
And we think , we like to think , that this is one of the major problems why all -- maybe not all -- but most of the e-@@ health projects fail , since we stopped listening .
This is my Wi@@ F@@ i scale . It &apos;s a very simple thing .
It &apos;s got one kno@@ b , on / off .
And every morning I ho@@ p on it .
And yes , I &apos;ve got a challenge , as you might see .
And I put my challenge on 95 k@@ g .
But the thing is that it &apos;s made this simple that whenever I ho@@ p on , it s@@ ends my data through Google Health as well .
And it &apos;s coll@@ ected by my general practi@@ tion@@ er as well , so he can see what &apos;s my problem in weight , not on the very moment that I need cardi@@ o@@ logic support or something like it , but also looking back@@ ward .
But there &apos;s another thing .
As some of you might know , I &apos;ve got more than 4@@ ,000 fol@@ lowers on Twitter .
So every morning I ho@@ p on my Wi@@ F@@ i scale and before I &apos;m in my car , people start talking to me , &quot; I think you need a light lunch today , Lu@@ ci@@ en . &quot;
But that &apos;s the nic@@ est thing that could happen , since this is pe@@ er pressure , pe@@ er pressure used to help patients -- since this could be used for ob@@ es@@ ity , it could be used to stop smo@@ king in patients .
But on the other hand , it also could be used to get people from out of their ch@@ airs and try to work together in some kind of gam@@ ing activity to get more control of their health .
As of next week , it will soon be available .
There will be this little blood pressure meter connected to an iPhone or something or other .
And people will be able , from their homes , to take their blood pressure , send it into their doctor and eventually share it with others , for instance , for over a hundred dollars .
And this is the point where patients get into position and can collect , not only their own control again , be cap@@ t@@ ain of their own ship , but also can help us in health care due to the challenges that we face , like health care cost explosion , doubl@@ ed demand and things like that .
M@@ ake techniques that are easy to use and start with this to embr@@ ace patients in the team .
And you can do this with techniques like this , but also by crow@@ d-@@ sour@@ c@@ ing .
And one of the things we did I would like to share with you introduced by a little video .
We &apos;ve all got navig@@ ation contr@@ ols in our car .
We maybe even &#91; have &#93; it in our cell@@ phone .
We know perfectly where all the A@@ T@@ M@@ s are about the city of Ma@@ as@@ tri@@ ch@@ t .
The other thing is we know where all the gas stations are .
And sure , we could find fast food ch@@ ains .
But where would be the near@@ est A@@ ED to help this patient ?
We asked around and nobody knew .
No@@ body knew where the near@@ est life@@ -@@ saving A@@ ED was to be ob@@ t@@ ained right now .
So what we did , we crow@@ d@@ sour@@ c@@ ed The Ne@@ ther@@ lands .
We set up a website and asked the crow@@ d , &quot; If you see an A@@ ED , please sub@@ mit it , tell us where it is , tell us when it &apos;s open , &quot; since sometimes in office hours sometimes it &apos;s closed , of course .
And over 10,000 A@@ E@@ D@@ s already in The Ne@@ ther@@ lands already have been sub@@ mit@@ ted .
The next step we took was to find the applications for it .
And we built an iP@@ ad application .
We made an application for L@@ ay@@ ar , augment@@ ed reality , to find these A@@ E@@ D@@ s .
And whenever you are in a city like Ma@@ as@@ tri@@ ch@@ t and somebody collap@@ ses , you can use your iPhone , and within the next weeks also run your Microsoft cell@@ phone , to find the near@@ est A@@ ED which can save lives .
And as of today , we would like to introduce this , not only as A@@ E@@ D@@ 4@@ E@@ U , which is what the product is called , And we would like to start this on a worldwide level .
And &#91; we &apos;re &#93; asking all of our colleagues in the rest of the world , colle@@ ague univer@@ si@@ ties , to help us to find and work and act like a hu@@ b to crow@@ d-@@ source all these A@@ E@@ D@@ s all around the world .
That whenever you &apos;re on ho@@ li@@ day and somebody collap@@ ses , might it be your own relative or someone just in front of you , you can find this .
The other thing we would like to ask is of companies also all over the world that will be able to help us val@@ id@@ ate these A@@ E@@ D@@ s .
These might be cou@@ rier services or c@@ able guys for instance , just to see whether the A@@ ED that &apos;s sub@@ mit@@ ted still is in place .
So please help us on this one and try to make not only health a little bit better , but take control of it .
Thank you .
I &apos;m here to share my photograph@@ y .
Or is it photograph@@ y ?
Because , of course , this is a photograph that you can &apos;t take with your camera .
Yet , my interest in photograph@@ y started as I got my first digital camera at the age of 15 .
It mix@@ ed with my earlier passion for drawing , but it was a bit different , because using the camera , the process was in the planning instead .
And when you take a photograph with a camera , the process ends when you press the tr@@ ig@@ ger .
So to me it felt like photograph@@ y was more about being at the right place and the right time .
I felt like anyone could do that .
So I wanted to create something different , something where the process starts when you press the tr@@ ig@@ ger .
Ph@@ ot@@ os like this : construction going on along a bus@@ y road .
But it has an un@@ expected tw@@ ist .
And despite that , it ret@@ ains a level of re@@ alism .
Or photos like these -- both dark and color@@ ful , but all with a common goal of ret@@ aining the level of re@@ alism .
When I say re@@ alism , I mean phot@@ o-@@ re@@ alism .
Because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can capture really , but I always want it to look like it could have been cap@@ tured somehow as a photograph .
Ph@@ ot@@ os where you will need a bri@@ ef moment to think to figure out the trick .
So it &apos;s more about captur@@ ing an idea than about captur@@ ing a moment really .
But what &apos;s the trick that makes it look re@@ alis@@ tic ?
Is it something about the details or the colors ?
Is it something about the light ?
What creates the illusion ?
Sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
But in the end , it comes down to how we inter@@ pre@@ t the world and how it can be realized on a two-@@ dimensional surface .
It &apos;s not really what is re@@ alis@@ tic , it &apos;s what we think looks re@@ alis@@ tic really .
So I think the bas@@ ics are quite simple .
I just see it as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces of reality and put it together to create altern@@ ate reality .
And let me show you a simple example .
Here we have three perfectly imagin@@ able physical objects , something we all can rel@@ ate to living in a three-@@ dimensional world .
But combin@@ ed in a certain way , they can create something that still looks three-@@ dimensional , like it could exist .
But at the same time , we know it can &apos;t .
So we trick our brains , because our brain simply doesn &apos;t accept the fact that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
And I see the same process with combin@@ ing photograph@@ s .
It &apos;s just really about combin@@ ing different re@@ alities .
So the things that make a photograph look re@@ alis@@ tic , I think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t even think about , the things all around us in our daily lives .
But when combin@@ ing photograph@@ s , this is really important to consider , because otherwise it just looks wrong somehow .
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow to achieve a re@@ alis@@ tic result .
As you can see , these images aren &apos;t really special .
But combin@@ ed , they can create something like this .
So the first rule is that photos combin@@ ed should have the same perspective .
Sec@@ ond@@ ly , photos combin@@ ed should have the same type of light .
And these two images both ful@@ fill these two requi@@ rem@@ ents -- shot at the same he@@ ight and in the same type of light .
The third one is about making it impossible to distin@@ gu@@ ish where the different images begin and end by making it se@@ am@@ less .
M@@ ake it impossible to say how the image actually was com@@ posed .
So by mat@@ ching color , contr@@ ast and bri@@ ght@@ ness in the bor@@ ders between the different images , ad@@ ding photographi@@ c def@@ ects like de@@ p@@ th of field , des@@ atur@@ ated colors and noise , we er@@ ase the bor@@ ders between the different images and make it look like one single image , despite the fact that one image can cont@@ ain hundreds of lay@@ ers basically .
So here &apos;s another example .
One might think that this is just an image of a landscape and the lower part is what &apos;s manipul@@ ated .
But this image is actually entirely com@@ posed of photograph@@ s from different loc@@ ations .
I person@@ ally think that it &apos;s easier to actually create a place than to find a place , because then you don &apos;t need to com@@ promise with the ideas in your head .
But it does require a lot of planning .
And getting this idea during win@@ ter , I knew that I had several months to plan it , to find the different loc@@ ations for the pieces of the puzzle basically .
So for example , the fish was cap@@ tured on a fishing trip .
The shor@@ es are from a different location .
The underwater part was cap@@ tured in a stone p@@ it .
And yeah , I even turned the house on top of the island red to make it look more Swe@@ dis@@ h .
So to achieve a re@@ alis@@ tic result , I think it comes down to planning .
It always starts with a sk@@ et@@ ch , an idea .
Then it &apos;s about combin@@ ing the different photograph@@ s .
And here every piece is very well plann@@ ed .
And if you do a good job captur@@ ing the photos , the result can be quite beautiful and also quite re@@ alis@@ tic .
So all the tools are out there , and the only thing that lim@@ its us is our imagination .
Thank you .
Because I usually take the role of trying to explain to people how wonderful the new technologies that are coming along are going to be , and I thought that , since I was among friends here , I would tell you what I really think and try to look back and try to understand what is really going on here with these amazing ju@@ m@@ ps in technology that seem so fast that we can bar@@ ely keep on top of it .
So I &apos;m going to start out by showing just one very bor@@ ing technology slide .
And then , so if you can just turn on the slide that &apos;s on .
This is just a random slide that I picked out of my file .
What I want to show you is not so much the details of the slide , but the general form of it .
This happens to be a slide of some analysis that we were doing about the power of R@@ IS@@ C micro@@ proc@@ ess@@ ors versus the power of local area networks .
And the interesting thing about it is that this slide , like so many technology sli@@ des that we &apos;re used to , is a sort of a straight line on a sem@@ i-@@ lo@@ g cur@@ ve .
In other words , every step here represents an order of mag@@ n@@ itude in performance scale .
And this is a new thing that we talk about technology on sem@@ i-@@ lo@@ g cur@@ ves .
Some@@ thing really weird is going on here .
And that &apos;s basically what I &apos;m going to be talking about .
So , if you could bring up the lights .
If you could bring up the lights higher , because I &apos;m just going to use a piece of paper here .
Now why do we draw technology cur@@ ves in sem@@ i-@@ lo@@ g cur@@ ves ?
Well the answer is , if I drew it on a normal cur@@ ve where , let &apos;s say , this is years , this is time of some sort , and this is whatever measure of the technology that I &apos;m trying to graph , the graph@@ s look sort of sil@@ ly .
They sort of go like this .
And they don &apos;t tell us much .
Now if I graph , for instance , some other technology , say transport@@ ation technology , on a sem@@ i-@@ lo@@ g cur@@ ve , it would look very stupid , it would look like a fl@@ at line .
But when something like this happens , things are qu@@ al@@ it@@ atively changing .
So if transport@@ ation technology was moving along as fast as micro@@ proc@@ essor technology , then the day after tomorrow , I would be able to get in a tax@@ i ca@@ b and be in To@@ ky@@ o in 30 seconds .
It &apos;s not moving like that .
And there &apos;s nothing pre@@ ce@@ d@@ ented in the history of technology development of this kind of self-@@ fe@@ eding growth where you go by orders of mag@@ n@@ itude every few years .
Now the question that I &apos;d like to ask is , if you look at these exponenti@@ al cur@@ ves , they don &apos;t go on forever .
Th@@ ings just can &apos;t possibly keep changing as fast as they are .
One of two things is going to happen .
E@@ ither it &apos;s going to turn into a sort of classi@@ cal S@@ -@@ cur@@ ve like this , until something totally different comes along , or maybe it &apos;s going to do this .
That &apos;s about all it can do .
Now I &apos;m an optimis@@ t , so I sort of think it &apos;s probably going to do something like that .
If so , that means that what we &apos;re in the middle of right now is a transition .
We &apos;re sort of on this line in a transition from the way the world used to be to some new way that the world is .
And so what I &apos;m trying to ask , what I &apos;ve been asking myself , is what &apos;s this new way that the world is ?
What &apos;s that new state that the world is hea@@ ding toward ?
Because the transition seems very , very conf@@ using when we &apos;re right in the middle of it .
Now when I was a kid growing up , the future was kind of the year 2000 , and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000 .
Now here &apos;s a conference in which people talk about the future , and you notice that the future is still at about the year 2000 .
It &apos;s about as far as we go out .
So in other words , the future has kind of been sh@@ r@@ inking one year per year for my whole lifetime .
Now I think that the reason is because we all feel that something &apos;s happening there .
That transition is happening . We can all sense it .
And we know that it just doesn &apos;t make too much sense to think out 30 , 50 years because everything &apos;s going to be so different that a simple extra@@ pol@@ ation of what we &apos;re doing just doesn &apos;t make any sense at all .
So what I would like to talk about is what that could be , what that transition could be that we &apos;re going through .
Now in order to do that I &apos;m going to have to talk about a bunch of stuff that really has nothing to do with technology and computers .
Because I think the only way to understand this is to really step back and take a long time scale look at things .
So the time scale that I would like to look at this on is the time scale of life on Earth .
So I think this picture makes sense if you look at it a few billion years at a time .
So if you go back about two and a half billion years , the Earth was this big , ster@@ ile hun@@ k of rock with a lot of chemicals flo@@ ating around on it .
And if you look at the way that the chemicals got organized , we begin to get a pretty good idea of how they do it .
And I think that there &apos;s the@@ ories that are beginning to understand about how it started with R@@ NA , but I &apos;m going to tell a sort of simple story of it , which is that , at that time , there were little dro@@ ps of oil flo@@ ating around with all kinds of different re@@ cip@@ es of chemicals in them .
And some of those dro@@ ps of oil had a particular combin@@ ation of chemicals in them which caused them to in@@ corpor@@ ate chemicals from the outside and grow the dro@@ ps of oil .
And those that were like that started to sp@@ lit and di@@ vide .
And those were the most prim@@ itive forms of cells in a sense , those little dro@@ ps of oil .
But now those dro@@ ps of oil weren &apos;t really alive , as we say it now , because every one of them was a little random reci@@ pe of chemicals .
And every time it divi@@ ded , they got sort of un@@ equal di@@ vision of the chemicals within them .
And so every drop was a little bit different .
In fact , the dro@@ ps that were different in a way that caused them to be better at in@@ corpor@@ ating chemicals around them , grew more and in@@ corpor@@ ated more chemicals and divi@@ ded more .
So those tend@@ ed to live longer , get ex@@ pressed more .
Now that &apos;s sort of just a very simple chemical form of life , but when things got interesting was when these dro@@ ps learned a trick about abstr@@ action .
Some@@ how by ways that we don &apos;t quite understand , these little dro@@ ps learned to write down information .
They learned to record the information that was the reci@@ pe of the cell onto a particular kind of chemical called DNA .
So in other words , they worked out , in this min@@ d@@ less sort of evolutionary way , a form of writing that let them write down what they were , so that that way of writing it down could get cop@@ i@@ ed .
The amazing thing is that that way of writing seems to have st@@ ayed stea@@ dy since it evolved two and a half billion years ago .
In fact the reci@@ pe for us , our genes , is exactly that same code and that same way of writing .
In fact , every living cre@@ ature is written in exactly the same set of letters and the same code .
In fact , one of the things that I did just for am@@ usement pur@@ pos@@ es is we can now write things in this code .
And I &apos;ve got here a little 100 micro@@ gr@@ ams of white po@@ w@@ der , which I try not to let the security people see at air@@ ports .
But this has in it -- what I did is I took this code -- the code has standard letters that we use for symbo@@ liz@@ ing it -- and I wrote my business card onto a piece of DNA and am@@ pli@@ fied it 10 to the 22 times .
So if anyone would like a hundred million cop@@ ies of my business card , I have pl@@ enty for everyone in the room , and , in fact , everyone in the world , and it &apos;s right here .
If I had really been a e@@ go@@ ti@@ st , I would have put it into a virus and released it in the room .
So what was the next step ?
W@@ r@@ iting down the DNA was an interesting step .
And that caused these cells -- that kept them happy for another billion years .
But then there was another really interesting step where things became completely different , which is these cells started ex@@ changing and communic@@ ating information , so that they began to get communities of cells .
I don &apos;t know if you know this , but bacteria can actually exchange DNA .
Now that &apos;s why , for instance , antibio@@ tic res@@ istance has evolved .
Some bacteria figured out how to stay away from pen@@ ic@@ illi@@ n , and it went around sort of creating its little DNA information with other bacteria , and now we have a lot of bacteria that are res@@ istant to pen@@ ic@@ illi@@ n , because bacteria communicate .
Now what this communication allowed was communities to form that , in some sense , were in the same boat together ; they were syn@@ erg@@ istic .
So they surviv@@ ed or they failed together , which means that if a community was very successful , all the individuals in that community were repe@@ ated more and they were fav@@ o@@ red by evolution .
Now the transition point happened when these communities got so close that , in fact , they got together and decided to write down the whole reci@@ pe for the community together on one str@@ ing of DNA .
And so the next stage that &apos;s interesting in life took about another billion years .
And at that stage , we have multi-@@ cell@@ ular communities , communities of lots of different types of cells , working together as a single organis@@ m .
And in fact , we &apos;re such a multi-@@ cell@@ ular community .
We have lots of cells that are not out for themselves anymore .
Your skin cell is really us@@ eless without a heart cell , muscle cell , a brain cell and so on .
So these communities began to evol@@ ve so that the interesting level on which evolution was taking place was no longer a cell , but a community which we call an organis@@ m .
Now the next step that happened is within these communities .
These communities of cells , again , began to abstr@@ act information .
And they began building very special structures that did nothing but process information within the community .
And those are the neu@@ ral structures .
So neurons are the information proc@@ essing appar@@ at@@ us that those communities of cells built up .
And in fact , they began to get speci@@ alis@@ ts in the community and special structures that were responsible for recor@@ ding , understanding , learning information .
And that was the brains and the nervous system of those communities .
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage .
Because at that point , an individual -- learning could happen within the time sp@@ an of a single organis@@ m , instead of over this evolutionary time sp@@ an .
So an organis@@ m could , for instance , learn not to eat a certain kind of fruit because it tas@@ ted bad and it got sick last time it ate it .
That could happen within the lifetime of a single organis@@ m , wh@@ ereas before they &apos;d built these special information proc@@ essing structures , that would have had to be learned evolu@@ tion@@ arily over hundreds of thousands of years by the individuals dying off that ate that kind of fruit .
So that nervous system , the fact that they built these special information structures , tremend@@ ously sp@@ ed up the whole process of evolution .
Because evolution could now happen within an individual .
It could happen in learning time sc@@ ales .
But then what happened was the individuals worked out , of course , tric@@ ks of communic@@ ating .
And for example , the most sophistic@@ ated version that we &apos;re aware of is human language .
It &apos;s really a pretty amazing invention if you think about it .
Here I have a very complicated , mess@@ y , conf@@ used idea in my head .
I &apos;m sitting here making gr@@ un@@ ting sounds basically , and hopefully construc@@ ting a similar mess@@ y , conf@@ used idea in your head that be@@ ars some analo@@ g@@ y to it .
But we &apos;re taking something very complicated , turning it into sound , se@@ quences of sounds , and producing something very complicated in your brain .
So this allows us now to begin to start func@@ tioning as a single organis@@ m .
And so , in fact , what we &apos;ve done is we , humanity , have started abstr@@ acting out .
We &apos;re going through the same levels that multi-@@ cell@@ ular organisms have gone through -- abstr@@ acting out our metho@@ ds of recor@@ ding , pres@@ enting , proc@@ essing information .
So for example , the invention of language was a tiny step in that direction .
T@@ ele@@ ph@@ ony , computers , vide@@ ot@@ apes , C@@ D@@ -@@ R@@ O@@ M@@ s and so on are all our speci@@ alized mechan@@ is@@ ms that we &apos;ve now built within our society for hand@@ ling that information .
And it all connec@@ ts us together into something that is much bigger and much faster and able to evol@@ ve than what we were before .
So now , evolution can take place on a scale of micro@@ seconds .
And you saw T@@ y &apos;s little evolutionary example where he sort of did a little bit of evolution on the Con@@ volution program right before your eyes .
So now we &apos;ve spe@@ e@@ ded up the time sc@@ ales once again .
So the first steps of the story that I told you about took a billion years a piece .
And the next steps , like nervous systems and brains , took a few hundred million years .
Then the next steps , like language and so on , took less than a million years .
And these next steps , like electron@@ ics , seem to be taking only a few decades .
The process is fe@@ eding on itself and becoming , I guess , auto@@ cat@@ aly@@ tic is the word for it -- when something re@@ in@@ forces its rate of change .
The more it changes , the faster it changes .
And I think that that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing here in this explosion of cur@@ ve .
We &apos;re seeing this process fe@@ eding back on itself .
Now I design computers for a living , and I know that the mechan@@ is@@ ms that I use to design computers would be impossible without recent adv@@ ances in computers .
So right now , what I do is I design objects at such complexity that it &apos;s really impossible for me to design them in the traditional sense .
I don &apos;t know what every trans@@ ist@@ or in the connection machine does .
There are billions of them .
Instead , what I do and what the designers at Th@@ inking M@@ ach@@ ines do is we think at some level of abstr@@ action and then we hand it to the machine and the machine takes it beyond what we could ever do , much far@@ ther and faster than we could ever do .
And in fact , sometimes it takes it by metho@@ ds that we don &apos;t quite even understand .
One method that &apos;s particularly interesting that I &apos;ve been using a lot l@@ ately is evolution itself .
So what we do is we put inside the machine a process of evolution that takes place on the micro@@ second time scale .
So for example , in the most extreme cases , we can actually evol@@ ve a program by starting out with random se@@ quences of instructions .
S@@ ay , &quot; Com@@ pu@@ ter , would you please make a hundred million random se@@ quences of instructions .
Now would you please run all of those random se@@ quences of instructions , run all of those programs , and pick out the ones that came clo@@ s@@ est to doing what I wanted . &quot;
So in other words , I define what I wanted .
Let &apos;s say I want to sort numbers , as a simple example I &apos;ve done it with .
So find the programs that come clo@@ s@@ est to sor@@ ting numbers .
So of course , random se@@ quences of instructions are very un@@ likely to sort numbers , so none of them will really do it .
But one of them , by lu@@ ck , may put two numbers in the right order .
And I say , &quot; Com@@ pu@@ ter , would you please now take the 10 percent of those random se@@ quences that did the best job .
S@@ ave those . K@@ ill off the rest .
And now let &apos;s re@@ produce the ones that sor@@ ted numbers the best .
And let &apos;s re@@ produce them by a process of re@@ combin@@ ation analo@@ g@@ ous to sex . &quot;
Take two programs and they produce children by ex@@ changing their su@@ br@@ out@@ ines , and the children inher@@ it the traits of the su@@ br@@ out@@ ines of the two programs .
So I &apos;ve got now a new generation of programs that are produced by combin@@ ations of the programs that did a little bit better job .
S@@ ay , &quot; Please repe@@ at that process . &quot;
S@@ core them again .
In@@ tro@@ duce some mu@@ tations perhaps .
And try that again and do that for another generation .
Well every one of those generations just takes a few mill@@ is@@ ec@@ on@@ ds .
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution on that within the computer in a few minutes , or in the complicated cases , in a few hours .
At the end of that , I end up with programs that are absolutely perfect at sor@@ ting numbers .
In fact , they are programs that are much more efficient than programs I could have ever written by hand .
Now if I look at those programs , I can &apos;t tell you how they work .
I &apos;ve tried looking at them and telling you how they work .
They &apos;re obs@@ cure , weird programs .
But they do the job .
And in fact , I know , I &apos;m very confi@@ dent that they do the job because they come from a line of hundreds of thousands of programs that did the job .
In fact , their life depend@@ ed on doing the job .
I was ri@@ ding in a 7@@ 4@@ 7 with Mar@@ vin Min@@ sky once , and he pul@@ ls out this card and says , &quot; Oh look . Look at this .
It says , &apos; This plane has hundreds of thousands of tiny parts working together to make you a safe flight . &apos; Do@@ esn &apos;t that make you feel confi@@ dent ? &quot;
In fact , we know that the engineering process doesn &apos;t work very well when it gets complicated .
So we &apos;re beginning to de@@ pend on computers to do a process that &apos;s very different than engineering .
And it lets us produce things of much more complexity than normal engineering lets us produce .
And yet , we don &apos;t quite understand the options of it .
So in a sense , it &apos;s getting ahead of us .
We &apos;re now using those programs to make much faster computers so that we &apos;ll be able to run this process much faster .
So it &apos;s fe@@ eding back on itself .
The thing is becoming faster and that &apos;s why I think it seems so conf@@ using .
Because all of these technologies are fe@@ eding back on themselves .
We &apos;re taking off .
And what we are is we &apos;re at a point in time which is analo@@ g@@ ous to when sing@@ le-@@ cel@@ led organisms were turning into multi-@@ cel@@ led organisms .
So we &apos;re the a@@ mo@@ e@@ b@@ as and we can &apos;t quite figure out what the hell this thing is we &apos;re creating .
We &apos;re right at that point of transition .
But I think that there really is something coming along after us .
I think it &apos;s very hau@@ gh@@ ty of us to think that we &apos;re the end product of evolution .
And I think all of us here are a part of producing whatever that next thing is .
So lunch is coming along , and I think I will stop at that point , before I get sel@@ ected out .
I think we have to do something about a piece of the culture of medicine that has to change .
And I think it starts with one physici@@ an , and that &apos;s me .
And maybe I &apos;ve been around long enough that I can afford to give away some of my fal@@ se pres@@ ti@@ ge to be able to do that .
Be@@ fore I actually begin the meat of my talk , let &apos;s begin with a bit of baseball .
Hey , why not ?
We &apos;re near the end , we &apos;re getting close to the World Ser@@ ies .
We all love baseball , don &apos;t we ?
Bas@@ eball is filled with some amazing statistics .
And there &apos;s hundreds of them .
&quot; Mon@@ ey@@ ball &quot; is about to come out , and it &apos;s all about statistics and using statistics to build a great baseball team .
I &apos;m going to focus on one st@@ at that I hope a lot of you have heard of .
It &apos;s called bat@@ ting average .
So we talk about a 300 , a bat@@ ter who bats 300 .
That means that ball@@ player bat@@ ted saf@@ ely , hit saf@@ ely three times out of 10 at bats .
That means hit the ball into the out@@ field , it dro@@ pped , it didn &apos;t get caught , and wh@@ o@@ ever tried to throw it to first base didn &apos;t get there in time and the run@@ ner was safe .
Three times out of 10 .
Do you know what they call a 300 h@@ it@@ ter in Ma@@ j@@ or Le@@ ague Bas@@ eball ?
Good , really good , maybe an all@@ -@@ star .
Do you know what they call a 400 baseball h@@ it@@ ter ?
That &apos;s somebody who hit , by the way , four times saf@@ ely out of every 10 .
L@@ eg@@ end@@ ary -- as in T@@ ed Willi@@ ams leg@@ end@@ ary -- the last Ma@@ j@@ or Le@@ ague Bas@@ eball player to hit over 400 during a regular se@@ ason .
Now let &apos;s take this back into my world of medicine where I &apos;m a lot more comfortable , or perhaps a bit less comfortable after what I &apos;m going to talk to you about .
Su@@ p@@ pose you have app@@ en@@ di@@ ci@@ tis and you &apos;re refer@@ red to a surge@@ on who &apos;s bat@@ ting 400 on app@@ end@@ ect@@ om@@ ies .
Some@@ how this isn &apos;t working out , is it ?
Now suppose you live in a certain part of a certain remote place and you have a loved one who has bloc@@ k@@ ages in two cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ ter@@ ies and your family doctor ref@@ ers that loved one to a cardi@@ o@@ logist who &apos;s bat@@ ting 200 on ang@@ io@@ plas@@ ties .
But , but , you know what ?
She &apos;s doing a lot better this year . She &apos;s on the com@@ e@@ back tr@@ ail .
And she &apos;s h@@ itting a 25@@ 7 .
Some@@ how this isn &apos;t working .
But I &apos;m going to ask you a question .
What do you think a bat@@ ting average for a cardi@@ ac surge@@ on or a nur@@ se practi@@ tion@@ er or an or@@ th@@ op@@ e@@ di@@ c surge@@ on , an O@@ B@@ G@@ Y@@ N , a par@@ am@@ e@@ di@@ c is supposed to be ?
1,000 , very good .
Now truth of the matter is , nobody knows in all of medicine what a good surge@@ on or physici@@ an or par@@ am@@ e@@ di@@ c is supposed to b@@ at .
What we do though is we send each one of them , including myself , out into the world with the ad@@ mon@@ ition , be perfect .
N@@ ever ever , ever make a mis@@ take , but you worry about the details , about how that &apos;s going to happen .
And that was the message that I absor@@ bed when I was in med school .
I was an obs@@ essive comp@@ ul@@ sive student .
In high school , a class@@ mate once said that Bri@@ an Gol@@ d@@ man would study for a blood test .
And so I did .
And I studied in my little gar@@ re@@ t at the nur@@ ses &apos; res@@ id@@ ence at Tor@@ onto Gen@@ eral Ho@@ sp@@ ital , not far from here .
And I mem@@ or@@ ized everything .
I mem@@ or@@ ized in my an@@ atom@@ y class the orig@@ ins and exer@@ tions of every muscle , every bran@@ ch of every ar@@ tery that came off the a@@ or@@ ta , differ@@ enti@@ al diagno@@ ses obs@@ cure and common .
I even knew the differ@@ enti@@ al diagno@@ sis in how to classi@@ fy ren@@ al tu@@ bul@@ ar aci@@ do@@ sis .
And all the while , I was am@@ ass@@ ing more and more knowledge .
And I did well , I gradu@@ ated with hon@@ ors , cu@@ m lau@@ de .
And I came out of medical school with the impression that if I mem@@ or@@ ized everything and knew everything , or as much as possible , as close to everything as possible , that it would imm@@ uni@@ ze me against making mis@@ takes .
And it worked for a while , until I met M@@ r@@ s@@ . D@@ ru@@ ck@@ er .
I was a res@@ ident at a teaching hospital here in Tor@@ onto when M@@ r@@ s@@ . D@@ ru@@ ck@@ er was brought to the emer@@ gency de@@ partment of the hospital where I was working .
At the time I was as@@ signed to the cardi@@ ology service on a cardi@@ ology rot@@ ation .
And it was my job , when the emer@@ gency staf@@ f called for a cardi@@ ology consul@@ t , to see that patient in emer@@ g .
and to report back to my attend@@ ing .
And I saw M@@ r@@ s@@ . D@@ ru@@ ck@@ er , and she was bre@@ ath@@ less .
And when I listen@@ ed to her , she was making a whe@@ e@@ z@@ y sound .
And when I listen@@ ed to her ch@@ est with a ste@@ tho@@ sc@@ ope , I could hear cr@@ ack@@ ly sounds on both sides that told me that she was in con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure .
This is a condition in which the heart fai@@ ls , and instead of being able to pu@@ mp all the blood forward , some of the blood b@@ acks up into the lun@@ g , the lun@@ gs fill up with blood , and that &apos;s why you have shor@@ t@@ ness of breath .
And that wasn &apos;t a difficult diagno@@ sis to make .
I made it and I set to work tre@@ ating her .
I gave her aspir@@ in . I gave her medic@@ ations to reli@@ eve the str@@ ain on her heart .
I gave her medic@@ ations that we call di@@ u@@ re@@ tics , water p@@ ills , to get her to pe@@ e out the access flu@@ id .
And over the course of the next hour and a half or two , she started to feel better .
And I felt really good .
And that &apos;s when I made my first mis@@ take ; I sent her home .
Actually , I made two more mis@@ takes .
I sent her home without speaking to my attend@@ ing .
I didn &apos;t pick up the phone and do what I was supposed to do , which was call my attend@@ ing and run the story by him so he would have a chance to see her for himself .
And he knew her , he would have been able to fur@@ n@@ ish addi@@ tional information about her .
Maybe I did it for a good reason .
Maybe I didn &apos;t want to be a high-@@ main@@ ten@@ ance res@@ ident .
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and so able to take responsibility that I would do so and I would be able to take care of my attend@@ ing &apos;s patients without even having to contact him .
The second mis@@ take that I made was worse .
In sending her home , I dis@@ regar@@ ded a little voice deep down inside that was trying to tell me , &quot; Gol@@ d@@ man , not a good idea . Don &apos;t do this . &quot;
In fact , so l@@ acking in confidence was I that I actually asked the nur@@ se who was looking after M@@ r@@ s@@ . D@@ ru@@ ck@@ er , &quot; Do you think it &apos;s okay if she goes home ? &quot;
And the nur@@ se thought about it and said very mat@@ ter@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ fac@@ tly , &quot; Yeah , I think she &apos;ll do okay . &quot;
I can remember that like it was yesterday .
So I signed the dis@@ charge pap@@ ers , and an am@@ bul@@ ance came , par@@ am@@ e@@ dic@@ s came to take her home .
And I went back to my work on the wards .
All the rest of that day , that after@@ no@@ on , I had this kind of gn@@ a@@ wing feeling inside my stom@@ ach .
But I car@@ ried on with my work .
And at the end of the day , I p@@ acked up to leave the hospital and walked to the parking lot to take my car and drive home when I did something that I don &apos;t usually do .
I walked through the emer@@ gency de@@ partment on my way home .
And it was there that another nur@@ se , not the nur@@ se who was looking after M@@ r@@ s@@ . D@@ ru@@ ck@@ er before , but another nur@@ se , said three words to me that are the three words that most emer@@ gency physici@@ ans I know dre@@ ad .
O@@ thers in medicine dre@@ ad them as well , but there &apos;s something particular about emer@@ gency medicine because we see patients so fle@@ et@@ ingly .
The three words are : Do you remember ?
&quot; Do you remember that patient you sent home ? &quot;
the other nur@@ se asked mat@@ ter@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ fac@@ tly .
&quot; Well she &apos;s back , &quot; in just that t@@ one of voice .
Well she was back all right .
She was back and near death .
A@@ bout an hour after she had arrived home , after I &apos;d sent her home , she collap@@ sed and her family called 9@@ 11 and the par@@ am@@ e@@ dic@@ s brought her back to the emer@@ gency de@@ partment where she had a blood pressure of 50 , which is in sev@@ ere shoc@@ k .
And she was bar@@ ely brea@@ thing and she was blue .
And the emerg@@ . staf@@ f pul@@ led out all the stop@@ s .
They gave her medic@@ ations to raise her blood pressure .
They put her on a venti@@ l@@ ator .
And I was shoc@@ ked and sh@@ ak@@ en to the core .
And I went through this rol@@ ler co@@ aster , because after they st@@ ab@@ ili@@ zed her , she went to the inten@@ sive care unit , and I hop@@ ed against hope that she would re@@ cover .
And over the next two or three days , it was clear that she was never going to wake up .
She had ir@@ re@@ ver@@ sible brain damage .
And the family gath@@ ered .
And over the course of the next eight or nine days , they res@@ ign@@ ed themselves to what was happening .
And at about the nine day mark , they let her go -- M@@ r@@ s@@ . D@@ ru@@ ck@@ er , a wife , a mother and a grandmother .
They say you never forget the names of those who die .
And that was my first time to be acqu@@ ain@@ ted with that .
Over the next few weeks , I beat myself up and I experienced for the first time the un@@ healthy sh@@ ame that exists in our culture of medicine -- where I felt alone , isol@@ ated , not feeling the healthy kind of sh@@ ame that you feel , because you can &apos;t talk about it with your colleagues .
You know that healthy kind , when you be@@ tr@@ ay a secret that a best friend made you promise never to reve@@ al and then you get bu@@ st@@ ed and then your best friend confron@@ ts you and you have terrible discus@@ sions , but at the end of it all that sick feeling gu@@ ides you and you say , I &apos;ll never make that mis@@ take again .
And you make am@@ ends and you never make that mis@@ take again .
That &apos;s the kind of sh@@ ame that is a teacher .
The un@@ healthy sh@@ ame I &apos;m talking about is the one that makes you so sick inside .
It &apos;s the one that says , not that what you did was bad , but that you are bad .
And it was what I was feeling .
And it wasn &apos;t because of my attend@@ ing ; he was a dol@@ l .
He talked to the family , and I &apos;m quite sure that he smo@@ o@@ th@@ ed things over and made sure that I didn &apos;t get su@@ ed .
And I kept asking myself these questions .
Why didn &apos;t I ask my attend@@ ing ? Why did I send her home ?
And then at my worst moments : Why did I make such a stupid mis@@ take ?
Why did I go into medicine ?
S@@ low@@ ly but su@@ rely , it lif@@ ted .
I began to feel a bit better .
And on a clou@@ dy day , there was a cr@@ ack in the clou@@ ds and the sun started to come out and I wonder@@ ed , maybe I could feel better again .
And I made myself a b@@ arg@@ ain that if only I re@@ double my efforts to be perfect and never make another mis@@ take again , please make the voices stop .
And they did .
And I went back to work .
And then it happened again .
Two years later I was an attend@@ ing in the emer@@ gency de@@ partment at a community hospital just nor@@ th of Tor@@ onto , and I saw a 25 year-old man with a so@@ re thro@@ at .
It was bus@@ y , I was in a bit of a hur@@ ry .
He kept poin@@ ting here .
I looked at his thro@@ at , it was a little bit p@@ ink .
And I gave him a pres@@ cri@@ ption for pen@@ ic@@ illi@@ n and sent him on his way .
And even as he was walking out the door , he was still sort of poin@@ ting to his thro@@ at .
And two days later I came to do my next emer@@ gency shift , and that &apos;s when my chi@@ ef asked to speak to me qui@@ et@@ ly in her office .
And she said the three words : Do you remember ?
&quot; Do you remember that patient you saw with the so@@ re thro@@ at ? &quot;
Well it turns out , he didn &apos;t have a stre@@ p thro@@ at .
He had a potenti@@ ally life@@ -@@ threat@@ ening condition called ep@@ ig@@ l@@ ot@@ ti@@ tis .
You can Google it , but it &apos;s an infection , not of the thro@@ at , but of the up@@ per air@@ way , and it can actually cause the air@@ way to close .
And fortunately he didn &apos;t die .
He was placed on in@@ trav@@ en@@ ous antibio@@ tics and he re@@ covered after a few days .
And I went through the same period of sh@@ ame and re@@ crimin@@ ations and felt cle@@ ans@@ ed and went back to work , until it happened again and again and again .
T@@ wi@@ ce in one emer@@ gency shift , I miss@@ ed app@@ en@@ di@@ ci@@ tis .
Now that takes some doing , especially when you work in a hospital that at the time saw but 14 people a night .
Now in both cases , I didn &apos;t send them home and I don &apos;t think there was any gap in their care .
One I thought had a kid@@ ney stone .
I or@@ der@@ ed a kid@@ ney X@@ -@@ ray . When it turned out to be normal , my colle@@ ague who was doing a re@@ ass@@ ess@@ ment of the patient noticed some tend@@ er@@ ness in the right lower qu@@ ad@@ rant and called the surge@@ ons .
The other one had a lot of di@@ arr@@ he@@ a .
I or@@ der@@ ed some flu@@ ids to re@@ hy@@ dr@@ ate him and asked my colle@@ ague to re@@ ass@@ ess him .
And he did and when he noticed some tend@@ er@@ ness in the right lower qu@@ ad@@ rant , called the surge@@ ons .
In both cases , they had their oper@@ ations and they did okay .
But each time , they were gn@@ a@@ wing at me , eating at me .
And I &apos;d like to be able to say to you that my worst mis@@ takes only happened in the first five years of practice as many of my colleagues say , which is total B@@ .@@ S .
Some of my do@@ o@@ z@@ ies have been in the last five years .
Al@@ one , ash@@ amed and un@@ sup@@ ported .
Here &apos;s the problem : If I can &apos;t come clean and talk about my mis@@ takes , if I can &apos;t find the s@@ till@@ -@@ small voice that tells me what really happened , how can I share it with my colleagues ?
How can I teach them about what I did so that they don &apos;t do the same thing ?
If I were to walk into a room -- like right now , I have no idea what you think of me .
When was the last time you heard somebody talk about failure after failure after failure ?
Oh yeah , you go to a cock@@ tail party and you might hear about some other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody talking about their own mis@@ takes .
If I were to walk into a room filled with my colle@@ ages and ask for their support right now and start to tell what I &apos;ve just told you right now , I probably wouldn &apos;t get through two of those stories before they would start to get really un@@ comfortable , somebody would cr@@ ack a jo@@ ke , they &apos;d change the subject and we would move on .
And in fact , if I knew and my colleagues knew that one of my or@@ th@@ op@@ e@@ di@@ c colleagues took off the wrong leg in my hospital , believe me , I &apos;d have trouble making eye contact with that person .
That &apos;s the system that we have .
It &apos;s a complete den@@ ial of mis@@ takes .
It &apos;s a system in which there are two kinds of physici@@ ans -- those who make mis@@ takes and those who don &apos;t , those who can &apos;t hand@@ le sleep de@@ priv@@ ation and those who can , those who have l@@ ous@@ y out@@ comes and those who have great out@@ comes .
And it &apos;s almost like an ide@@ o@@ logical reaction , like the anti@@ bodies begin to attack that person .
And we have this idea that if we drive the people who make mis@@ takes out of medicine , what will we be left with , but a safe system .
But there are two problems with that .
In my 20 years or so of medical broad@@ cas@@ ting and journalis@@ m , I &apos;ve made a personal study of medical mal@@ practice and medical er@@ r@@ ors to learn everything I can , from one of the first articles I wrote for the Tor@@ onto St@@ ar to my show &quot; Wh@@ ite Co@@ at , B@@ lack Art . &quot;
And what I &apos;ve learned is that er@@ r@@ ors are absolutely u@@ bi@@ quit@@ ous .
We work in a system where er@@ r@@ ors happen every day , where one in 10 medic@@ ations are either the wrong medic@@ ation given in hospital or at the wrong do@@ sage , where hospit@@ al-@@ ac@@ qui@@ red inf@@ ections are getting more and more nu@@ mer@@ ous , caus@@ ing hav@@ o@@ c and death .
In this country , as many as 2@@ 4@@ ,000 Can@@ adi@@ ans die of prev@@ ent@@ able medical er@@ r@@ ors .
In the United States , the Institute of Medic@@ ine pe@@ gg@@ ed it at 100,000 .
In both cases , these are gro@@ ss under@@ esti@@ mates , because we really aren &apos;t fer@@ re@@ ting out the problem as we should .
And here &apos;s the thing .
In a hospital system where medical knowledge is doubl@@ ing every two or three years , we can &apos;t keep up with it .
S@@ le@@ ep de@@ priv@@ ation is absolutely per@@ vas@@ ive .
We can &apos;t get rid of it .
We have our cognitive bi@@ ases , so that I can take a perfect history on a patient with ch@@ est pain .
Now take the same patient with ch@@ est pain , make them mo@@ ist and gar@@ r@@ ul@@ ous and put a little bit of al@@ co@@ ho@@ l on their breath , and suddenly my history is l@@ ac@@ ed with con@@ temp@@ t .
I don &apos;t take the same history .
I &apos;m not a robot ; I don &apos;t do things the same way each time .
And my patients aren &apos;t cars ; they don &apos;t tell me their sympt@@ oms in the same way each time .
G@@ iv@@ en all of that , mis@@ takes are in@@ ev@@ itable .
So if you take the system , as I was taught , and we@@ ed out all the er@@ r@@ or@@ -@@ pr@@ one health professi@@ on@@ als , well there won &apos;t be anybody left .
And you know that business about people not wan@@ ting to talk about their worst cases ?
On my show , on &quot; Wh@@ ite Co@@ at , B@@ lack Art , &quot; I made it a hab@@ it of saying , &quot; Here &apos;s my worst mis@@ take , &quot; I would say to everybody from par@@ am@@ e@@ dic@@ s to the chi@@ ef of cardi@@ ac surgery , &quot; Here &apos;s my worst mis@@ take , &quot; bl@@ ah , bl@@ ah , bl@@ ah , bl@@ ah , bl@@ ah , &quot; What about y@@ ours ? &quot; and I would point the micro@@ phone towards them .
And their pu@@ p@@ ils would dil@@ ate , they would reco@@ il , then they would look down and s@@ wal@@ low hard and start to tell me their stories .
They want to tell their stories . They want to share their stories .
They want to be able to say , &quot; Look , don &apos;t make the same mis@@ take I did . &quot;
What they need is an environment to be able to do that .
What they need is a re@@ defined medical culture .
And it starts with one physici@@ an at a time .
The re@@ defined physici@@ an is human , knows she &apos;s human , accep@@ ts it , isn &apos;t proud of making mis@@ takes , but stri@@ ves to learn one thing from what happened that she can teach to somebody else .
She shares her experience with others .
She &apos;s sup@@ por@@ tive when other people talk about their mis@@ takes .
And she points out other people &apos;s mis@@ takes , not in a got@@ ch@@ a way , but in a lo@@ ving , sup@@ por@@ tive way so that everybody can benefit .
And she works in a culture of medicine that ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ges that human beings run the system , and when human beings run the system , they will make mis@@ takes from time to time .
So the system is evol@@ ving to create back@@ u@@ ps that make it easier to detect those mis@@ takes that humans in@@ ev@@ it@@ ably make and also fo@@ sters in a lo@@ ving , sup@@ por@@ tive way places where everybody who is obser@@ ving in the health care system can actually point out things that could be potential mis@@ takes and is re@@ war@@ ded for doing so , and especially people like me , when we do make mis@@ takes , we &apos;re re@@ war@@ ded for coming clean .
My name is Bri@@ an Gol@@ d@@ man .
I am a re@@ defined physici@@ an .
I &apos;m human . I make mis@@ takes .
I &apos;m sorry about that , but I str@@ ive to learn one thing that I can pass on to other people .
I still don &apos;t know what you think of me , but I can live with that .
And let me close with three words of my own : I do remember .
Do you know how many choices you make in a typical day ?
Do you know how many choices you make in typical week ?
I recently did a sur@@ vey with over 2,000 Americans , and the average number of choices that the typical American re@@ ports making is about 70 in a typical day .
There was also recently a study done with CE@@ O@@ s in which they followed CE@@ O@@ s around for a whole week .
And these scientists simply document@@ ed all the various tas@@ ks that these CE@@ O@@ s engaged in and how much time they spent engag@@ ing in making decisions related to these tas@@ ks .
And they found that the average CE@@ O engaged in about 1@@ 3@@ 9 tas@@ ks in a week .
Each task was made up of many , many , many sub-@@ choices of course .
50 percent of their decisions were made in nine minutes or less .
On@@ ly about 12 percent of the decisions did they make an hour or more of their time .
Think about your own choices .
Do you know how many choices make it into your nine minute categ@@ ory versus your one hour categ@@ ory ?
How well do you think you &apos;re doing at manag@@ ing those choices ?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest modern day cho@@ os@@ ing problems that we have , which is the choice over@@ load problem .
I want to talk about the problem and some potential solutions .
Now as I talk about this problem , I &apos;m going to have some questions for you and I &apos;m going to want to know your answers .
So when I ask you a question , since I &apos;m blind , only raise your hand if you want to bur@@ n off some cal@@ ories .
O@@ ther@@ wise , when I ask you a question , and if your answer is yes , I &apos;d like you to cl@@ ap your hands .
So for my first question for you today : Are you guys ready to hear about the choice over@@ load problem ?
Thank you .
So when I was a graduate student at Stanford University , I used to go to this very , very up@@ scale gro@@ cer@@ y store ; at least at that time it was truly up@@ scale .
It was a store called D@@ ra@@ e@@ ger &apos;s .
Now this store , it was almost like going to an am@@ usement park .
They had 250 different kinds of mu@@ star@@ ds and v@@ ine@@ gars and over 500 different kinds of fruits and veget@@ ables and more than two do@@ zen different kinds of bot@@ t@@ led water -- and this was during a time when we actually used to drink ta@@ p water .
I used to love going to this store , but on one occasion I asked myself , well how come you never buy anything ?
Here &apos;s their o@@ live oil ais@@ le .
They had over 75 different kinds of o@@ live oil , including those that were in a loc@@ ked case that came from thou@@ sand@@ -year-old o@@ live trees .
So I one day decided to pay a visit to the man@@ ager , and I asked the man@@ ager , &quot; Is this model of off@@ ering people all this choice really working ? &quot;
And he poin@@ ted to the bus@@ lo@@ ads of tour@@ ists that would show up everyday , with cameras ready usually .
We decided to do a little experiment , and we picked j@@ am for our experiment .
Here &apos;s their j@@ am ais@@ le .
They had 3@@ 4@@ 8 different kinds of j@@ am .
We set up a little tas@@ ting bo@@ oth right near the entr@@ ance of the store .
We there put out six different fl@@ av@@ ors of j@@ am or 24 different fl@@ av@@ ors of j@@ am , and we looked at two things : First , in which case were people more likely to stop , sam@@ ple some j@@ am ?
More people stopped when there were 24 , about 60 percent , than when there were six , about 40 percent .
The next thing we looked at is in which case were people more likely to buy a j@@ ar of j@@ am .
Now we see the opposite effect .
Of the people who stopped when there were 24 , only three percent of them actually bought a j@@ ar of j@@ am .
Of the people who stopped when there were six , well now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a j@@ ar of j@@ am .
Now if you do the math , people were at least six times more likely to buy a j@@ ar of j@@ am if they en@@ coun@@ tered six than if they en@@ coun@@ tered 24 .
Now cho@@ os@@ ing not to buy a j@@ ar of j@@ am is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our wai@@ st@@ lines -- but it turns out that this choice over@@ load problem aff@@ ects us even in very conse@@ qu@@ enti@@ al decisions .
We choose not to choose , even when it goes against our best self-@@ interes@@ ts .
So now for the top@@ ic of today : financial sav@@ ings .
Now I &apos;m going to describe to you a study I did with Gu@@ r Hu@@ ber@@ man , Em@@ ir K@@ amen@@ ica , We@@ i J@@ ang where we looked at the reti@@ rement sav@@ ings decisions of nearly a million Americans from about 6@@ 50 plans all in the U.@@ S .
And what we looked at was whether the number of fu@@ nd off@@ er@@ ings available in a reti@@ rement sav@@ ings plan , the 4@@ 0@@ 1 plan , does that affect people &apos;s lik@@ eli@@ hood to save more for tomorrow .
And what we found was that indeed there was a cor@@ relation .
So in these plans , we had about 6@@ 5@@ 7 plans that rang@@ ed from off@@ ering people anywhere from two to 5@@ 9 different fu@@ nd off@@ er@@ ings .
And what we found was that , the more fun@@ ds off@@ ered , indeed , there was less participation rate .
So if you look at the extre@@ mes , those plans that off@@ ered you two fun@@ ds , participation rates were around in the mi@@ d-@@ 7@@ 0s -- still not as high as we want it to be .
In those plans that off@@ ered nearly 60 fun@@ ds , participation rates have now dro@@ pped to about the 6@@ 0@@ th per@@ centi@@ le .
Now it turns out that even if you do choose to particip@@ ate when there are more choices present , even then , it has negative consequences .
So for those people who did choose to particip@@ ate , the more choices available , the more likely people were to completely avoid stoc@@ ks or equ@@ ity fun@@ ds .
The more choices available , the more likely they were to put all their money in pure money market accoun@@ ts .
Now ne@@ ither of these extreme decisions are the kinds of decisions that any of us would re@@ comm@@ end for people when you &apos;re consider@@ ing their future financial well-@@ being .
Well , over the past decade , we have obser@@ ved three main negative consequences to off@@ ering people more and more choices .
They &apos;re more likely to del@@ ay cho@@ os@@ ing -- pro@@ cr@@ as@@ tin@@ ate even when it goes against their best self-@@ interest .
They &apos;re more likely to make worse choices -- worse financial choices , medical choices .
They &apos;re more likely to choose things that make them less satis@@ fied , even when they do objec@@ tively better .
The main reason for this is because , we might enjoy g@@ az@@ ing at those giant walls of may@@ onn@@ ai@@ ses , mu@@ star@@ ds , v@@ ine@@ gars , jam@@ s , but we can &apos;t actually do the math of compar@@ ing and contr@@ as@@ ting and actually pic@@ king from that stun@@ ning dis@@ play .
So what I want to propose to you today are four simple techniques -- techniques that we have tes@@ ted in one way or another in different research ven@@ ues -- that you can easily apply in your businesses .
The first : C@@ ut .
You &apos;ve heard it said before , but it &apos;s never been more true than today , that less is more .
People are always up@@ set when I say , &quot; C@@ ut . &quot;
They &apos;re always worried they &apos;re going to lose shel@@ f space .
But in fact , what we &apos;re seeing more and more is that if you are willing to cut , get rid of those extr@@ an@@ e@@ ous red@@ un@@ dant options , well there &apos;s an increase in s@@ ales , there &apos;s a lo@@ wer@@ ing of costs , there is an impro@@ vement of the cho@@ os@@ ing experience .
When Pro@@ c@@ tor &amp; amp ; G@@ am@@ ble went from 26 different kinds of H@@ ead &amp; amp ; Sh@@ oul@@ ders to 15 , they saw an increase in s@@ ales by 10 percent .
When the Gol@@ den C@@ at Cor@@ por@@ ation got rid of their 10 wor@@ st-@@ selling cat lit@@ ter products , they saw an increase in profits by 8@@ 7 percent -- a function of both increase in s@@ ales and lo@@ wer@@ ing of costs .
You know , the average gro@@ cer@@ y store today off@@ ers you 4@@ 5,000 products .
The typical Wal@@ mar@@ t today off@@ ers you 100,000 products .
But the n@@ in@@ th largest ret@@ ail@@ er , the n@@ in@@ th biggest ret@@ ail@@ er in the world today is Al@@ di , and it off@@ ers you only 1,@@ 400 products -- one kind of c@@ ann@@ ed tom@@ a@@ to sau@@ ce .
Now in the financial sav@@ ings world , I think one of the best examples that has recently come out on how to best manage the choice off@@ er@@ ings has actually been something that David L@@ ai@@ b@@ son was heav@@ ily involved in designing , which was the program that they have at Harvard .
Every single Harvard employ@@ ee is now autom@@ atically en@@ rol@@ led in a lif@@ ec@@ y@@ cle fu@@ nd .
For those people who actually want to choose , they &apos;re given 20 fun@@ ds , not 300 or more fun@@ ds .
You know , often , people say , &quot; I don &apos;t know how to cut .
They &apos;re all important choices . &quot;
And the first thing I do is I ask the employ@@ ees , &quot; T@@ ell me how these choices are different from one another .
And if your employ@@ ees can &apos;t tell them apart , ne@@ ither can your consum@@ ers . &quot;
Now before we started our s@@ ession this after@@ no@@ on , I had a chat with G@@ ary .
And G@@ ary said that he would be willing to offer people in this audience an all@@ -@@ ex@@ pens@@ es-@@ paid free vac@@ ation to the most beautiful road in the world .
Here &apos;s a descri@@ ption of the road .
And I &apos;d like you to read it .
and then I want you to cl@@ ap your hands if you &apos;re ready to take G@@ ary up on his offer .
Okay . Any@@ body who &apos;s ready to take him up on his offer .
Is that all ?
All right , let me show you some more about this .
You guys knew there was a trick , didn &apos;t you .
Now who &apos;s ready to go on this trip .
I think I might have actually heard more hands .
All right .
Now in fact , you had objec@@ tively more information the first time around than the second time around , but I would venture to guess that you felt that it was more real the second time around .
Because the pictures made it feel more real to you .
Which brings me to the second technique for hand@@ ling the choice over@@ load problem , which is concre@@ tiz@@ ation .
That in order for people to understand the differences between the choices , they have to be able to understand the consequences associated with each choice , and that the consequences need to be felt in a vi@@ vi@@ d sort of way , in a very concre@@ te way .
Why do people spend an average of 15 to 30 percent more when they use an A@@ T@@ M card or a credit card as op@@ posed to cas@@ h ?
Because it doesn &apos;t feel like real money .
And it turns out that making it feel more concre@@ te can actually be a very positive tool to use in getting people to save more .
So a study that I did with Sh@@ l@@ om@@ o Ben@@ art@@ z@@ i and Al@@ ess@@ and@@ ro P@@ re@@ vit@@ er@@ o , we did a study with people at I@@ N@@ G -- employ@@ ees that are all working at I@@ N@@ G -- and now these people were all in a s@@ ession where they &apos;re doing en@@ ro@@ ll@@ ment for their 4@@ 0@@ 1 plan .
And during that s@@ ession , we kept the s@@ ession exactly the way it used to be , but we ad@@ ded one little thing .
The one little thing we ad@@ ded was we asked people to just think about all the positive things that would happen in your life if you saved more .
By doing that simple thing , there was an increase in en@@ ro@@ ll@@ ment by 20 percent and there was an increase in the amount of people willing to save or the amount that they were willing to put down into their sav@@ ings account by four percent .
The third technique : C@@ at@@ eg@@ or@@ ization .
We can hand@@ le more categ@@ ories than we can hand@@ le choices .
So for example , here &apos;s a study we did in a magazine ais@@ le .
It turns out that in W@@ eg@@ mans gro@@ cer@@ y stor@@ es up and down the nor@@ the@@ ast cor@@ ri@@ d@@ or , the magazine ais@@ les range anywhere from 3@@ 3@@ 1 different kinds of magaz@@ ines all the way up to 6@@ 6@@ 4 .
But you know what ?
If I show you 600 magaz@@ ines and I di@@ vide them up into 10 categ@@ ories , versus I show you 400 magaz@@ ines and di@@ vide them up into 20 categ@@ ories , you believe that I have given you more choice and a better cho@@ os@@ ing experience if I gave you the 400 than if I gave you the 600 .
Because the categ@@ ories tell me how to tell them apart .
Here are two different je@@ wel@@ ry dis@@ plays .
One is called &quot; J@@ az@@ z &quot; and the other one is called &quot; S@@ wing . &quot;
If you think the dis@@ play on the left is S@@ wing and the dis@@ play on the right is J@@ az@@ z , cl@@ ap your hands .
Okay , there &apos;s some .
If you think the one on the left is J@@ az@@ z and the one on the right is S@@ wing , cl@@ ap your hands .
Okay , a bit more .
Now it turns out you &apos;re right .
The one on the left is J@@ az@@ z and the one on the right is S@@ wing , but you know what ?
This is a highly us@@ eless categ@@ or@@ ization s@@ chem@@ e .
The categ@@ ories need to say something to the cho@@ os@@ er , not the cho@@ ic@@ e-@@ ma@@ ker .
And you often see that problem when it comes down to those long l@@ ists of all these fun@@ ds .
Who are they actually supposed to be inform@@ ing ?
My fourth technique : Con@@ dition for complexity .
It turns out we can actually hand@@ le a lot more information than we think we can , we &apos;ve just got to take it a little easier .
We have to gradu@@ ally increase the complexity .
I &apos;m going to show you one example of what I &apos;m talking about .
Let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : buying a car .
Here &apos;s a Ger@@ man car manufactu@@ rer that gives you the opportunity to completely cu@@ st@@ om make your car .
You &apos;ve got to make 60 different decisions , completely make up your car .
Now these decisions v@@ ary in the number of choices that they offer per decision .
Car colors , ex@@ ter@@ ior car colors -- I &apos;ve got 5@@ 6 choices .
En@@ g@@ ines , g@@ ear@@ shift -- four choices .
So now what I &apos;m going to do is I &apos;m going to v@@ ary the order in which these decisions appear .
So half of the custom@@ ers are going to go from high choice , 5@@ 6 car colors , to low choice , four g@@ ear@@ shif@@ ts .
The other half of the custom@@ ers are going to go from low choice , four g@@ ear@@ shif@@ ts , to 5@@ 6 car colors , high choice .
What am I going to look at ?
How engaged you are .
If you keep h@@ itting the de@@ fau@@ lt but@@ ton per decision , that means you &apos;re getting over@@ wh@@ el@@ med , that means I &apos;m losing you .
What you find is the people who go from high choice to low choice , they &apos;re h@@ itting that de@@ fau@@ lt but@@ ton over and over and over again .
We &apos;re losing them .
They go from low choice to high choice , they &apos;re h@@ ang@@ ing in there .
It &apos;s the same information . It &apos;s the same number of choices .
The only thing that I have done is I have vari@@ ed the order in which that information is pres@@ ented .
If I start you off easy , I learn how to choose .
Even though cho@@ os@@ ing g@@ ear@@ shift doesn &apos;t tell me anything about my pre@@ fer@@ ences for inter@@ ior dec@@ or , it still prepar@@ es me for how to choose .
It also gets me excited about this big product that I &apos;m putting together , so I &apos;m more willing to be motiv@@ ated to be engaged .
So let me rec@@ ap .
I have talked about four techniques for mi@@ ti@@ g@@ ating the problem of choice over@@ load -- cut -- get rid of the extr@@ an@@ e@@ ous altern@@ atives ; concre@@ ti@@ ze -- make it real ; categ@@ or@@ ize -- we can hand@@ le more categ@@ ories , less choices ; condition for complexity .
All of these techniques that I &apos;m descri@@ bing to you today are designed to help you manage your choices -- better for you , you can use them on yourself , better for the people that you are ser@@ ving .
Because I believe that the key to getting the most from choice is to be cho@@ os@@ y about cho@@ os@@ ing .
And the more we &apos;re able to be cho@@ os@@ y about cho@@ os@@ ing the better we will be able to practice the art of cho@@ os@@ ing .
Thank you very much .
In the 198@@ 0s in the commun@@ ist E@@ as@@ tern Germany , if you ow@@ ned a ty@@ pe@@ writer , you had to reg@@ ister it with the government .
You had to reg@@ ister a sam@@ ple she@@ et of text out of the ty@@ pe@@ writer .
And this was done so the government could track where text was coming from .
If they found a paper which had the wrong kind of thought , they could track down who created that thought .
And we in the West couldn &apos;t understand how anybody could do this , how much this would restric@@ t freedom of speech .
We would never do that in our own countries .
But today in 2011 , if you go and buy a color laser prin@@ ter from any major laser prin@@ ter manufactu@@ rer and print a page , that page will end up having s@@ light yellow dots prin@@ ted on every single page in a pattern which makes the page unique to you and to your prin@@ ter .
This is happening to us today .
And nobody seems to be making a fus@@ s about it .
And this is an example of the ways that our own governments are using technology against us , the citizens .
And this is one of the main three sources of online problems today .
If we take a look at what &apos;s really happening in the online world , we can group the attacks based on the att@@ ack@@ ers .
We have three main groups .
We have online crimin@@ als .
Like here , we have Mr. D@@ im@@ i@@ try Gol@@ u@@ bo@@ v from the city of Ki@@ e@@ v in U@@ k@@ r@@ aine .
And the mo@@ tives of online crimin@@ als are very easy to understand .
These guys make money .
They use online attacks to make lots of money , and lots and lots of it .
We actually have several cases of milli@@ on@@ aires online , multi@@ milli@@ on@@ aires , who made money with their attacks .
Here &apos;s V@@ la@@ di@@ m@@ ir T@@ s@@ ast@@ s@@ in form T@@ ar@@ tu in E@@ st@@ on@@ ia .
This is Al@@ f@@ red G@@ on@@ z@@ al@@ ez .
This is Steph@@ en Wat@@ t .
This is B@@ j@@ or@@ n S@@ un@@ d@@ in .
This is Mat@@ the@@ w Anderson , T@@ ari@@ q Al@@ -@@ D@@ a@@ our and so on and so on .
These guys make their for@@ tu@@ nes online , but they make it through the il@@ legal means of using things like ban@@ king tro@@ j@@ ans to ste@@ al money from our bank accoun@@ ts while we do online ban@@ king , or with ke@@ y@@ log@@ gers to collect our credit card information while we are doing online sh@@ op@@ ping from an inf@@ ected computer .
The U.S. Sec@@ re@@ t Ser@@ vice , two months ago , fro@@ ze the S@@ wis@@ s bank account of Mr. S@@ am J@@ ain right here , and that bank account had 14@@ .@@ 9 million U.S. dollars on it when it was fro@@ zen .
Mr. J@@ ain himself is on the loo@@ se ; nobody knows where he is .
And I claim it &apos;s already today that it &apos;s more likely for any of us to become the victi@@ m of a crime online than here in the real world .
And it &apos;s very obvious that this is only going to get worse .
In the future , the majority of crime will be happening online .
The second major group of att@@ ack@@ ers that we are watching today are not motiv@@ ated by money .
They &apos;re motiv@@ ated by something else -- motiv@@ ated by prot@@ ests , motiv@@ ated by an opinion , motiv@@ ated by the laugh@@ s .
G@@ rou@@ ps like An@@ ony@@ m@@ ous have ris@@ en up over the last 12 months and have become a major player in the field of online attacks .
So those are the three main att@@ ack@@ ers : crimin@@ als who do it for the money , hack@@ ti@@ vis@@ ts like An@@ ony@@ m@@ ous doing it for the prot@@ est , but then the last group are nation states , governments doing the attacks .
And then we look at cases like what happened in Di@@ gi@@ N@@ ot@@ ar .
This is a prime example of what happens when governments attack against their own citizens .
Di@@ gi@@ N@@ ot@@ ar is a C@@ er@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate Au@@ th@@ ority from The Ne@@ ther@@ lands -- or actually , it was .
It was running into ban@@ k@@ rup@@ t@@ cy last fall because they were h@@ acked into .
Some@@ body broke in and they h@@ acked it th@@ or@@ ough@@ ly .
And I asked last week in a meeting with D@@ ut@@ ch government repres@@ ent@@ atives , I asked one of the leaders of the team whether he found pl@@ au@@ sible that people died because of the Di@@ gi@@ N@@ ot@@ ar h@@ ack .
And his answer was yes .
So how do people die as the result of a h@@ ack like this ?
Well Di@@ gi@@ N@@ ot@@ ar is a C@@ .@@ A .
They sell cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates .
What do you do with cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates ?
Well you need a cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate if you have a website that has h@@ t@@ t@@ ps , S@@ S@@ L en@@ cry@@ p@@ ted services , services like G@@ mail .
Now we all , or a big part of us , use G@@ mail or one of their competi@@ tors , but these services are especially popular in tot@@ al@@ it@@ arian states like Iran , where dis@@ si@@ dents use foreign services like G@@ mail because they know they are more tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thy than the local services and they are en@@ cry@@ p@@ ted over S@@ S@@ L connections , so the local government can &apos;t s@@ no@@ op on their discus@@ sions .
Ex@@ cept they can if they h@@ ack into a foreign C@@ .@@ A .
and issue ro@@ gue cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates .
And this is exactly what happened with the case of Di@@ gi@@ N@@ ot@@ ar .
What about Arab S@@ pr@@ ing and things that have been happening , for example , in Egy@@ pt ?
Well in Egy@@ pt , the ri@@ ot@@ ers lo@@ ot@@ ed the head@@ quar@@ ters of the Egyp@@ tian secret police in A@@ pr@@ il 2011 , and when they were lo@@ oting the building they found lots of pap@@ ers .
A@@ mon@@ g those pap@@ ers , was this bin@@ der enti@@ t@@ led &quot; F@@ I@@ N@@ F@@ IS@@ H@@ E@@ R . &quot;
And within that bin@@ der were notes from a company based in Germany which had sold the Egyp@@ tian government a set of tools for inter@@ cep@@ ting -- and in very large scale -- all the communication of the citizens of the country .
They had sold this tool for 2@@ 8@@ 0,000 Euro@@ s to the Egyp@@ tian government .
The company head@@ quar@@ ters are right here .
So Western governments are provi@@ ding tot@@ al@@ it@@ arian governments with tools to do this against their own citizens .
But Western governments are doing it to themselves as well .
For example , in Germany , just a couple of weeks ago the so@@ -@@ called State Tro@@ j@@ an was found , which was a tro@@ j@@ an used by Ger@@ man government offici@@ als to investig@@ ate their own citizens .
If you are a susp@@ ect in a crimin@@ al case , well it &apos;s pretty obvious , your phone will be t@@ apped .
But today , it goes beyond that .
They will ta@@ p your Internet connection .
They will even use tools like State Tro@@ j@@ an to inf@@ ect your computer with a tro@@ j@@ an , which en@@ ables them to watch all your communication , to listen to your online discus@@ sions , to collect your pass@@ words .
Now when we think deeper about things like these , the obvious response from people should be that , &quot; Okay , that sounds bad , but that doesn &apos;t really affect me because I &apos;m a legal citiz@@ en .
Why should I worry ?
Because I have nothing to hide . &quot;
And this is an argument , which doesn &apos;t make sense .
Pri@@ v@@ acy is impli@@ ed .
Pri@@ v@@ acy is not up for discussion .
This is not a question between priv@@ acy against security .
It &apos;s a question of freedom against control .
And while we might trust our governments right now , right here in 2011 , any right we give away will be given away for good .
And do we trust , do we bl@@ ind@@ ly trust , any future government , a government we might have 50 years from now ?
And these are the questions that we have to worry about for the next 50 years .
This is where I live . I live in Kenya , at the south parts of the N@@ ai@@ rob@@ i National Park .
Those are my dad &apos;s co@@ ws at the back , and behind the co@@ ws , that &apos;s the N@@ ai@@ rob@@ i National Park .
N@@ ai@@ rob@@ i National Park is not f@@ enced in the south wid@@ ely , which means wild animals like z@@ e@@ bras migr@@ ate out of the park fre@@ ely .
So pre@@ dat@@ ors like lions follow them , and this is what they do .
They kill our liv@@ es@@ to@@ ck .
This is one of the co@@ ws which was killed at night , and I just w@@ oke up in the morning and I found it dead , and I felt so bad , because it was the only bul@@ l we had .
My community , the Ma@@ as@@ ai , we believe that we came from heav@@ en with all our animals and all the land for her@@ ding them , and that &apos;s why we value them so much .
So I grew up h@@ ating lions so much .
The mor@@ ans are the w@@ arri@@ ors who protect our community and the liv@@ es@@ to@@ ck , and they &apos;re also up@@ set about this problem .
So they kill the lions .
It &apos;s one of the six lions which were killed in N@@ ai@@ rob@@ i .
And I think this is why the N@@ ai@@ rob@@ i National Park lions are few .
So a boy , from six to nine years old , in my community is responsible for his dad &apos;s co@@ ws , and that &apos;s the same thing which happened to me .
So I had to find a way of solving this problem .
And the first idea I got was to use fire , because I thought lions were scar@@ ed of fire .
But I came to realize that that didn &apos;t really help , because it was even helping the lions to see through the co@@ w@@ sh@@ ed .
So I didn &apos;t give up . I continu@@ ed .
And a second idea I got was to use a scar@@ ec@@ row .
I was trying to trick the lions &#91; into thinking &#93; that I was standing near the co@@ w@@ sh@@ ed .
But lions are very cl@@ ever . They will come the first day and they see the scar@@ ec@@ row , and they go back , but the second day , they &apos;ll come and they say , this thing is not moving here , it &apos;s always here . So he ju@@ m@@ ps in and kill@@ s the animals .
So one night , I was walking around the co@@ w@@ sh@@ ed with a tor@@ ch , and that day , the lions didn &apos;t come .
And I discovered that lions are afraid of a moving light .
So I had an idea .
Since I was a small boy , I used to work in my room for the whole day , and I even took apart my mom &apos;s new radio , and that day she almost killed me , but I learned a lot about electron@@ ics . So I got an old car battery , an indic@@ ator box . It &apos;s a small device found in a mot@@ or@@ cycle , and it helps mot@@ or@@ ists when they want to turn right or left . It bl@@ in@@ ks .
And I got a switch where I can switch on the lights , on and off .
And that &apos;s a small tor@@ ch from a broken fl@@ ash@@ light .
So I set up everything .
As you can see , the solar pan@@ el charg@@ es the battery , and the battery sup@@ pli@@ es the power to the small indic@@ ator box . I call it a transform@@ er .
And the indic@@ ator box makes the lights fl@@ ash .
As you can see , the bul@@ bs face outside , because that &apos;s where the lions come from .
And that &apos;s how it looks to lions when they come at night .
The lights fl@@ ash and trick the lions into thinking I was walking around the co@@ w@@ sh@@ ed , but I was sle@@ e@@ ping in my bed .
Thanks .
So I set it up in my home two years ago , and since then , we have never experienced any problem with lions .
And my neighbor@@ ing homes heard about this idea .
One of them was this grandmother .
She had a lot of her animals being killed by lions , and she asked me if I could put the lights for her .
And I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
So I put the lights . You can see at the back , those are the li@@ on lights .
Since now , I &apos;ve set up seven homes around my community , and they &apos;re really working .
And my idea is also being used now all over Kenya for scar@@ ing other pre@@ dat@@ ors like hy@@ en@@ as , le@@ opar@@ ds , and it &apos;s also being used to sc@@ are ele@@ phants away from people &apos;s far@@ ms .
Because of this invention , I was lucky to get a sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ ship in one of the best schools in Kenya , Bro@@ ok@@ house International School , and I &apos;m really excited about this .
My new school now is coming in and helping by fun@@ d@@ rais@@ ing and creating an awareness .
I even took my friends back to my community , and we &apos;re install@@ ing the lights to the homes which don &apos;t have &#91; any &#93; , and I &apos;m teaching them how to put them .
So one year ago , I was just a boy in the sav@@ ann@@ a gr@@ ass@@ land her@@ ding my father &apos;s co@@ ws , and I used to see plan@@ es flying over , and I told myself that one day , I &apos;ll be there inside .
And here I am today .
I got a chance to come by plane for my first time for TED .
So my big dream is to become an air@@ craft engineer and pil@@ ot when I grow up .
I used to hate lions , but now because my invention is saving my father &apos;s co@@ ws and the lions , we are able to stay with the lions without any conflict .
A@@ sh@@ ê ol@@ ê@@ n . It means in my language , thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : You have no idea how exciting it is to hear a story like y@@ ours .
So you got this sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ shi@@ p@@ .@@ Richard Tur@@ ere : Y@@ ep .

When I was little , I thought my country was the best on the planet .
And I grew up sing@@ ing a song called &quot; No@@ thing To En@@ v@@ y . &quot;
And I was very proud .
In school , we spent a lot of time studying the history of K@@ im I@@ l@@ -@@ S@@ ung , but we never learned much about the outside world , except that America , South Kore@@ a , Japan are the enem@@ ies .
Al@@ though I often wonder@@ ed about the outside world , I thought I would spend my entire life in North Kore@@ a , until everything suddenly changed .
When I was seven years old , I saw my first public ex@@ ec@@ ution .
But I thought my life in North Kore@@ a was normal .
My family was not poor , and myself , I had never experienced hun@@ ger .
But one day , in 199@@ 5 , my mom brought home a letter from a co@@ wor@@ ker &apos;s sister .
It read , &quot; When you read this , our five family members will not exist in this world , because we haven &apos;t e@@ at@@ en for the past three weeks .
We are lying on the floor together , and our bodies are so wea@@ k , we are waiting to die . &quot;
I was so shoc@@ ked .
This was the first time I heard that people in my country were suffering .
So@@ on after , when I was walking past a train station , I saw something terrible that to this day I can &apos;t er@@ ase from my memory .
A li@@ fel@@ ess woman was lying on the ground , while an em@@ aci@@ ated child in her arms just star@@ ed hel@@ pl@@ ess@@ ly at his mother &apos;s face .
But nobody helped them , because they were so focused on taking care of themselves and their families .
A huge fam@@ ine hit North Kore@@ a in the mi@@ d-@@ 199@@ 0s .
U@@ l@@ timately , more than a million North Kore@@ ans died during the fam@@ ine , and many only surviv@@ ed by eating gr@@ ass , bu@@ gs and tree bar@@ k .
Po@@ wer out@@ ages also became more and more fre@@ quent , so everything around me was completely dark at night , except for the sea of lights in China , just across the river from my home .
I always wonder@@ ed why they had lights , but we didn &apos;t .
This is a satellite picture showing North Kore@@ a at night , compared to neighb@@ ors .
This is the Am@@ no@@ k Ri@@ ver , which ser@@ ves as a part of the bor@@ der between North Kore@@ a and China .
As you can see , the river can be very nar@@ row at certain points , allo@@ wing North Kore@@ ans to sec@@ ret@@ ly cross .
But many die .
Sometimes , I saw dead bodies flo@@ ating down the river .
I can &apos;t reve@@ al many details about how I left North Kore@@ a , but I only can say that during the u@@ g@@ ly years of the fam@@ ine , I was sent to China to live with dis@@ tant rel@@ atives .
But I only thought that I would be separ@@ ated from my family for a short time .
I could have never imagin@@ ed that it would take 14 years to live together .
In China , it was hard living as a young girl without my family .
I had no idea what life was going to be like as a North Kore@@ an refuge@@ e .
But I soon learned it &apos;s not only extremely difficult , it &apos;s also very dangerous , since North Kore@@ an refuge@@ es are considered in China as il@@ legal migr@@ ants .
So I was living in constant fear that my identity could be reve@@ aled , and I would be rep@@ atri@@ ated to a horrible f@@ ate , back in North Kore@@ a .
One day , my worst ni@@ ght@@ ma@@ re came true , when I was caught by the Chinese police , and brought to the police station for interro@@ gation .
Some@@ one had acc@@ used me of being North Kore@@ an , so they tes@@ ted my Chinese language abilities , and asked me tons of questions .
I was so scar@@ ed .
I thought my heart was going to explo@@ de .
If anything seemed un@@ natural , I could be im@@ pris@@ oned and rep@@ atri@@ ated .
I thought my life was over .
But I managed to control all the emotions inside me , and answer the questions .
After they finished ques@@ tioning me , one offici@@ al said to another , &quot; This was a fal@@ se report . She &apos;s not North Kore@@ an . &quot;
And they let me go . It was a miracle .
Some North Kore@@ ans in China see@@ k as@@ y@@ lu@@ m in foreign em@@ bas@@ si@@ es .
But many can be caught by the Chinese police , and rep@@ atri@@ ated .
These girls were so lucky .
Even though they were caught , they were eventually released , after heavy international pressure .
These North Kore@@ ans were not so lucky .
Every year , coun@@ t@@ less North Kore@@ ans are caught in China and rep@@ atri@@ ated to North Kore@@ a , where they can be tor@@ tured , im@@ pris@@ oned , or public@@ ly ex@@ ecu@@ ted .
Even though I was really fortun@@ ate to get out , many other North Kore@@ ans have not been so lucky .
It &apos;s trag@@ ic that North Kore@@ ans have to hide their identi@@ ties and struggle so hard just to survive .
Even after learning a new language and getting a job , their whole world can be turned up@@ side down in an instant .
That &apos;s why , after 10 years of hi@@ ding my identity , I decided to risk going to South Kore@@ a .
And I started a new life yet again .
S@@ et@@ t@@ ling down in South Kore@@ a was a lot more challeng@@ ing than I had expected .
English was so important in South Kore@@ a , so I had to start learning my third language .
Al@@ so , I realized there was a wide gap between North and South .
We are all Kore@@ an , but inside , we have become very different , due to 6@@ 7 years of di@@ vision .
I even went through an identity crisis .
A@@ m I South Kore@@ an or North Kore@@ an ?
Where am I from ? Who am I ?
Su@@ dd@@ enly , there was no country I could pr@@ ou@@ dly call my own .
Even though ad@@ just@@ ing to life in South Kore@@ a was not easy , I made a plan -- I started studying for the university entr@@ ance ex@@ am .
Just as I was starting to get used to my new life , I received a shoc@@ king phone call .
The North Kore@@ an auth@@ ori@@ ties inter@@ cep@@ ted some money that I sent to my family , and , as a pun@@ ish@@ ment , my family was going to be for@@ ci@@ bly re@@ moved to a des@@ ol@@ ate location in the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side .
They had to get out quickly .
So I started planning how to help them es@@ cape .
North Kore@@ ans have to travel incredible dist@@ ances on the path to freedom .
It &apos;s almost impossible to cross the bor@@ der between North Kore@@ a and South Kore@@ a .
So , iron@@ ically , I took a flight back to China and hea@@ ded toward the North Kore@@ an bor@@ der .
Since my family couldn &apos;t speak Chinese , I had to guide them somehow through more than 2,000 miles in China , and then into Sou@@ the@@ ast Asia .
The journey by bus took one week , and we were almost caught several times .
One time , our bus was stopped and bo@@ ar@@ ded by a Chinese police off@@ ic@@ er .
He took everyone &apos;s I@@ .@@ D@@ . cards , and he started asking them questions .
Since my family couldn &apos;t understand Chinese , I thought my family was going to be ar@@ res@@ ted .
As the Chinese off@@ ic@@ er appro@@ ach@@ ed my family , I impul@@ sively stood up , and I told him that these are dea@@ f and du@@ m@@ b people that I was chap@@ er@@ oning .
He looked at me susp@@ ici@@ ously , but lu@@ ck@@ ily , he believed me .
We made it all the way to the bor@@ der of La@@ os .
But I had to spend almost all my money to bri@@ be the bor@@ der gu@@ ards in La@@ os .
But even after we got past the bor@@ der , my family was ar@@ res@@ ted and j@@ ailed for il@@ legal bor@@ der cross@@ ing .
After I paid the fine and bri@@ be , my family was released in one month .
But soon after , my family was ar@@ res@@ ted and j@@ ailed again , in the capital of La@@ os .
This was one of the low@@ est points in my life .
I did everything to get my family to freedom , and we came so close , but my family was thro@@ wn in j@@ ail , just a short distance from the South Kore@@ an emb@@ ass@@ y .
I went back and forth between the im@@ migr@@ ation office and the police station , des@@ per@@ ately trying to get my family out .
but I didn &apos;t have enough money to pay a bri@@ be or fine anymore .
I lost all hope .
At that moment , I heard one man &apos;s voice ask me , &quot; What &apos;s wrong ? &quot;
I was so surprised that a total str@@ anger car@@ ed enough to ask .
In my broken English , and with a dic@@ tionary , I expl@@ ained the situation , and without h@@ es@@ it@@ ating , the man went to the A@@ T@@ M , and he paid the rest of the money for my family , and two other North Kore@@ ans to get out of j@@ ail .
I th@@ an@@ ked him with all my heart , and I asked him , &quot; Why are you helping me ? &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not helping you , &quot; he said .
&quot; I &apos;m helping the North Kore@@ an people . &quot;
I realized that this was a symbo@@ lic moment in my life .
The kind str@@ anger symbo@@ li@@ zed new hope for me and the North Kore@@ an people , when we needed it most .
And he showed me that the k@@ ind@@ ness of str@@ angers and the support of the international community are truly the r@@ ays of hope we North Kore@@ an people need .
E@@ ven@@ tually , after our long journey , my family and I were re@@ un@@ ited in South Kore@@ a .
But getting to freedom is only half the bat@@ tle .
Many North Kore@@ ans are separ@@ ated from their families , and when they arrive in a new country , they start with little or no money .
So we can benefit from the international community for education , English language training , job training , and more .
We can also act as a bridge between the people inside North Kore@@ a and the outside world .
Because many of us stay in contact with family members still inside , and we send information and money that is helping to change North Kore@@ a from inside .
I &apos;ve been so lucky , received so much help and inspiration in my life , so I want to help give aspir@@ ing North Kore@@ ans a chance to prosp@@ er with international support .
I &apos;m confi@@ dent that you will see more and more North Kore@@ ans succe@@ eding all over the world , including the TED stage .
Thank you .
I live in South Centr@@ al .
This is South Centr@@ al : li@@ qu@@ or stor@@ es , fast food , vac@@ ant lots .
So the city plann@@ ers , they get together and they figure they &apos;re going to change the name South Centr@@ al to make it represent something else , so they change it to South Los Angeles , like this is going to fix what &apos;s really going wrong in the city .
This is South Los Angeles . Li@@ qu@@ or stor@@ es , fast food , vac@@ ant lots .
Just like 2@@ 6@@ .@@ 5 million other Americans , I live in a food desert , South Centr@@ al Los Angeles , F@@ un@@ ny thing is , the dri@@ ve-@@ thr@@ us are killing more people than the dri@@ ve-@@ b@@ ys .
People are dying from cur@@ able diseases in South Centr@@ al Los Angeles .
For instance , the ob@@ es@@ ity rate in my neighborhood is five times higher than , say , B@@ ever@@ ly H@@ ills , which is probably eight , 10 miles away .
I got ti@@ red of seeing this happening .
And I was wondering , how would you feel if you had no access to healthy food , if every time you walk out your door you see the ill effects that the present food system has on your neighborhood ?
I see whe@@ el@@ ch@@ airs bought and sold like used cars .
I see di@@ aly@@ sis centers po@@ pping up like St@@ ar@@ bu@@ cks .
And I figured , this has to stop .
So I figured that the problem is the solution .
F@@ ood is the problem and food is the solution .
Plus I got ti@@ red of driving 45 minutes round trip to get an app@@ le that wasn &apos;t im@@ pregn@@ ated with p@@ esti@@ ci@@ des .
So what I did , I plan@@ ted a food forest in front of my house .
It was on a stri@@ p of land that we call a par@@ k@@ way .
It &apos;s 150 feet by 10 feet .
Th@@ ing is , it &apos;s ow@@ ned by the city .
But you have to ma@@ intain it .
So I &apos;m like , &quot; Co@@ ol . I can do whatever the hell I want , since it &apos;s my responsibility and I got@@ ta ma@@ intain it . &quot;
And this is how I decided to ma@@ intain it .
So me and my group , L@@ .@@ A. Gre@@ en Gr@@ ounds , we got together and we started plan@@ ting my food forest , fruit trees , you know , the whole nine , veget@@ ables .
What we do , we &apos;re a pay@@ -@@ it-@@ forward kind of group , where it &apos;s com@@ posed of gar@@ den@@ ers from all wal@@ ks of life , from all over the city , and it &apos;s completely volunte@@ er , and everything we do is free .
And the gar@@ den , it was beautiful .
And then somebody compl@@ ained .
The city came down on me , and basically gave me a c@@ itation saying that I had to re@@ move my gar@@ den , which this c@@ itation was turning into a w@@ arr@@ ant .
And I &apos;m like , &quot; Come on , really ?
A w@@ arr@@ ant for plan@@ ting food on a piece of land that you could care less about ? &quot; And I was like , &quot; Co@@ ol . Br@@ ing it . &quot;
Because this time it wasn &apos;t coming up .
So L@@ .@@ A. Times got ah@@ old of it . Steve L@@ op@@ ez did a story on it and talked to the coun@@ c@@ il@@ man , and one of the Gre@@ en Gr@@ ounds members , they put up a peti@@ tion on Ch@@ ang@@ e@@ .@@ or@@ g , and with 9@@ 00 sig@@ natu@@ res , we were a success .
We had a vic@@ t@@ ory on our hands .
My coun@@ c@@ il@@ man even called in and said how they end@@ or@@ se and love what we &apos;re doing .
I mean , come on , why wouldn &apos;t they ?
L@@ .@@ A. leads the United States in vac@@ ant lots that the city actually ow@@ ns .
They own 26 square miles of vac@@ ant lots .
That &apos;s 20 Centr@@ al Par@@ ks .
That &apos;s enough space to plant 7@@ 25 million tom@@ a@@ to plants .
Why in the hell would they not okay this ?
Gro@@ wing one plant will give you 1,000 , 10,000 see@@ ds .
When one dollar &apos;s worth of green be@@ ans will give you 75 dollars &apos; worth of produce .
It &apos;s my go@@ spe@@ l , when I &apos;m telling people , grow your own food .
Gro@@ wing your own food is like printing your own money .
See , I have a leg@@ acy in South Centr@@ al .
I grew up there . I raised my sons there .
And I refu@@ se to be a part of this manufactu@@ red reality that was manufactu@@ red for me by some other people , and I &apos;m manufactu@@ ring my own reality .
See , I &apos;m an artist .
Gar@@ den@@ ing is my gr@@ aff@@ it@@ i . I grow my art .
Just like a gr@@ aff@@ it@@ i artist , where they beauti@@ fy walls , me , I beauti@@ fy law@@ ns , par@@ k@@ ways .
I use the gar@@ den , the soil , like it &apos;s a piece of cl@@ oth , and the plants and the trees , that &apos;s my emb@@ ell@@ ish@@ ment for that cl@@ oth .
You &apos;d be surprised what the soil could do if you let it be your can@@ v@@ as .
You just couldn &apos;t imagine how amazing a sun@@ flo@@ wer is and how it aff@@ ects people .
So what happened ?
I have wit@@ n@@ essed my gar@@ den become a tool for the education , a tool for the transformation of my neighborhood .
To change the community , you have to change the com@@ position of the soil .
We are the soil .
You &apos;d be surprised how kids are affected by this .
Gar@@ den@@ ing is the most therap@@ eu@@ tic and de@@ fi@@ ant act you can do , especially in the inner city .
Plus you get str@@ aw@@ ber@@ ries .
I remember this time , there was this mother and a daughter came , it was , like , 10 : 30 at night , and they were in my y@@ ard , and I came out and they looked so ash@@ amed .
So I &apos;m like , man , it made me feel bad that they were there , and I told them , you know , you don &apos;t have to do this like this .
This is on the street for a reason .
It made me feel ash@@ amed to see people that were this close to me that were hun@@ gry , and this only re@@ in@@ forced why I do this , and people asked me , &quot; F@@ in , aren &apos;t you afraid people are going to ste@@ al your food ? &quot;
And I &apos;m like , &quot; H@@ ell no , I ain &apos;t afraid they &apos;re g@@ onn@@ a ste@@ al it .
That &apos;s why it &apos;s on the street .
That &apos;s the whole idea .
I want them to take it , but at the same time , I want them to take back their health . &quot;
There &apos;s another time when I put a gar@@ den in this hom@@ eless shel@@ ter in down@@ town Los Angeles .
These are the guys , they helped me un@@ load the truc@@ k .
It was cool , and they just shared the stories about how this affected them and how they used to plant with their mother and their grandmother , and it was just cool to see how this changed them , if it was only for that one moment .
So Gre@@ en Gr@@ ounds has gone on to plant maybe 20 gard@@ ens .
We &apos;ve had , like , 50 people come to our dig@@ -@@ ins and particip@@ ate , and it &apos;s all volunte@@ ers .
If kids grow k@@ ale , kids eat k@@ ale .
If they grow tom@@ ato@@ es , they eat tom@@ ato@@ es . But when none of this is pres@@ ented to them , if they &apos;re not shown how food aff@@ ects the mind and the body , they bl@@ ind@@ ly eat whatever the hell you put in front of them .
I see young people and they want to work , but they &apos;re in this thing where they &apos;re caught up -- I see kids of color and they &apos;re just on this track that &apos;s designed for them , that leads them to no@@ where .
So with gar@@ den@@ ing , I see an opportunity where we can train these kids to take over their communities , to have a sustainable life .
And when we do this , who knows ?
We might produce the next George Washington Car@@ ver .
but if we don &apos;t change the com@@ position of the soil , we will never do this .
Now this is one of my plans . This is what I want to do .
I want to plant a whole block of gard@@ ens where people can share in the food in the same block .
I want to take shi@@ pping cont@@ ain@@ ers and turn them into healthy caf@@ es .
Now don &apos;t get me wrong .
I &apos;m not talking about no free sh@@ it , because free is not sustainable .
The funny thing about sustain@@ ability , you have to sust@@ ain it .
What I &apos;m talking about is putting people to work , and getting kids off the street , and l@@ etting them know the joy , the pri@@ de and the hon@@ or in growing your own food , opening far@@ mer &apos;s markets .
So what I want to do here , we got@@ ta make this sex@@ y .
So I want us all to become ec@@ ol@@ u@@ tionary ren@@ eg@@ ades , g@@ ang@@ st@@ as , g@@ ang@@ st@@ a gar@@ den@@ ers .
We got@@ ta fli@@ p the s@@ cript on what a g@@ ang@@ st@@ a is .
If you ain &apos;t a gar@@ den@@ er , you ain &apos;t g@@ ang@@ st@@ a .
G@@ et g@@ ang@@ st@@ a with your sho@@ v@@ el , okay ?
And let that be your wea@@ pon of choice .
So basically , if you want to meet with me , you know , if you want to meet , don &apos;t call me if you want to sit around in cus@@ h@@ y ch@@ airs and have me@@ et@@ ings where you talk about doing some sh@@ it -- where you talk about doing some sh@@ it .
If you want to meet with me , come to the gar@@ den with your sho@@ v@@ el so we can plant some sh@@ it .
P@@ ea@@ ce . Thank you .
Thank you .
You probably all agree with me that this is a very nice road .
It &apos;s made of as@@ ph@@ al@@ t , and as@@ ph@@ al@@ t is a very nice material to drive on , but not always , especially not on these days as today , when it &apos;s r@@ aining a lot .
Then you can have a lot of s@@ plas@@ h water in the as@@ ph@@ al@@ t .
And especially if you then ride with your bic@@ y@@ cle , and pass these cars , then that &apos;s not very nice .
Al@@ so , as@@ ph@@ al@@ t can create a lot of noise .
It &apos;s a no@@ is@@ y material , and if we produce ro@@ ads like in the Ne@@ ther@@ lands , very close to cities , then we would like a sil@@ ent road .
The solution for that is to make ro@@ ads out of por@@ ous as@@ ph@@ al@@ t .
Por@@ ous as@@ ph@@ al@@ t , a material that we use now in most of the high@@ ways in the Ne@@ ther@@ lands , it has po@@ res and water can just rain through it , so all the rain@@ water will flow away to the sides , and you have a road that &apos;s easy to drive on , so no s@@ plas@@ h water anymore .
Al@@ so the noise will dis@@ appear in these po@@ res .
Because it &apos;s very hol@@ low , all the noise will dis@@ appear , so it &apos;s a very sil@@ ent road .
It also has dis@@ adv@@ antages , of course , and the dis@@ advantage of this road is that rav@@ eling can occu@@ r .
What is rav@@ eling ? You see that in this road that the st@@ ones at the surface come off .
First you get one stone , then several more , and more and more and more and more , and then they -- well , I will not do that . But they can damage your w@@ ind@@ shi@@ eld , so you &apos;re not happy with that .
And finally , this rav@@ eling can also lead to more and more damage .
Sometimes you can create po@@ tho@@ les with that .
H@@ a . He &apos;s ready .
Po@@ tho@@ les , of course , that can become a problem , but we have a solution .
Here you see actually how the damage appe@@ ars in this material .
It &apos;s a por@@ ous as@@ ph@@ al@@ t , like I said , so you have only a small amount of bin@@ der between the st@@ ones .
D@@ ue to wea@@ ther@@ ing , due to U.@@ V@@ . light , due to ox@@ id@@ ation , this bin@@ der , this b@@ itu@@ men , the g@@ lue between the ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ates is going to sh@@ r@@ ink , and if it sh@@ r@@ in@@ ks , it gets micro-@@ cr@@ acks , and it del@@ amin@@ ates from the ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ates .
Then if you drive over the road , you take out the ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ates -- what we just saw here .
To solve this problem , we thought of self-@@ heal@@ ing materials .
If we can make this material self-@@ heal@@ ing , then probably we have a solution .
So what we can do is use ste@@ el w@@ o@@ ol just to clean p@@ ans , and the ste@@ el w@@ o@@ ol we can cut in very small pieces , and these very small pieces we can mi@@ x to the b@@ itu@@ men .
So then you have as@@ ph@@ al@@ t with very small pieces of ste@@ el w@@ o@@ ol in it .
Then you need a machine , like you see here , that you can use for coo@@ king -- an in@@ duction machine .
In@@ duction can heat , especially ste@@ el ; it &apos;s very good at that .
Then what you do is you heat up the ste@@ el , you mel@@ t the b@@ itu@@ men , and the b@@ itu@@ men will flow into these micro-@@ cr@@ acks , and the st@@ ones are again fix@@ ed to the surface .
Today I use a micro@@ wave because I cannot take the big in@@ duction machine here on@@ stage .
So a micro@@ wave is a similar system .
So I put the spec@@ im@@ en in , which I &apos;m now going to take out to see what happened .
So this is the spec@@ im@@ en coming out now .
So I said we have such an industrial machine in the lab to heat up the spec@@ im@@ ens .
We tes@@ ted a lot of spec@@ im@@ ens there , and then the government , they actually saw our results , and they thought , &quot; Well , that &apos;s very interesting . We have to try that . &quot;
So they don@@ ated to us a piece of high@@ way , 400 meters of the A@@ 5@@ 8 , where we had to make a test track to test this material .
So that &apos;s what we did here . You see where we were making the test road , and then of course this road will last several years without any damage . That &apos;s what we know from practice .
So we took a lot of sam@@ ples from this road and we tes@@ ted them in the lab .
So we did aging on the sam@@ ples , did a lot of lo@@ ad@@ ing on it , heal@@ ed them with our in@@ duction machine , and heal@@ ed them and tes@@ ted them again .
S@@ ever@@ al times we can repe@@ at that .
So actually , the conclusion from this research is that if we go on the road every four years with our heal@@ ing machine -- this is the big version we have made to go on the real road -- if we go on the road every four years we can double the surface life of this road , which of course sav@@ es a lot of money .
Well , to conclu@@ de , I can say that we made a material using ste@@ el fi@@ bers , the addition of ste@@ el fi@@ bers , using in@@ duction energy to really increase the surface life of the road , double the surface life you can even do , so it will really save a lot of money with very simple tric@@ ks .
And now you &apos;re of course curious if it also worked .
So we still have the spec@@ im@@ en here . It &apos;s quite warm .
Actually , it still has to cool down first before I can show you that the heal@@ ing works .
But I will do a trial .
Let &apos;s see . Yeah , it worked .
Thank you .
When I was 11 , I remember w@@ aking up one morning to the sound of joy in my house .
My father was listening to B@@ BC Ne@@ ws on his small , gr@@ ay radio .
There was a big s@@ mile on his face which was unusual then , because the news mostly de@@ pressed him .
&quot; The T@@ ali@@ ban are gone ! &quot; my father sh@@ ou@@ ted .
I didn &apos;t know what it meant , but I could see that my father was very , very happy .
&quot; You can go to a real school now , &quot; he said .
A morning that I will never forget .
A real school .
You see , I was six when the T@@ ali@@ ban took over Afghanistan and made it il@@ legal for girls to go to school .
So for the next five years , I dr@@ essed as a boy to es@@ cor@@ t my older sister , who was no longer allowed to be outside alone , to a secret school .
It was the only way we both could be educ@@ ated .
Each day , we took a different route so that no one would susp@@ ect where we were going .
We would cover our books in gro@@ cer@@ y b@@ ags so it would seem we were just out sh@@ op@@ ping .
The school was in a house , more than 100 of us p@@ acked in one small living room .
It was co@@ z@@ y in win@@ ter but extremely hot in summer .
We all knew we were ris@@ king our lives -- the teacher , the students and our parents .
From time to time , the school would suddenly be can@@ cel@@ ed for a week because T@@ ali@@ ban were susp@@ ici@@ ous .
We always wonder@@ ed what they knew about us .
W@@ ere we being followed ?
Do they know where we live ?
We were scar@@ ed , but still , school was where we wanted to be .
I was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was pr@@ ized and dau@@ gh@@ ters were tre@@ a@@ su@@ red .
My grand@@ father was an extraordinary man for his time .
A total m@@ aver@@ ick from a remote pro@@ v@@ ince of Afghanistan , he ins@@ is@@ ted that his daughter , my mom , go to school , and for that he was dis@@ ow@@ ned by his father .
But my educ@@ ated mother became a teacher .
There she is .
She reti@@ red two years ago , only to turn our house into a school for girls and women in our neighborhood .
And my father -- that &apos;s him -- he was the first ever in his family to rece@@ ive an education .
There was no question that his children would rece@@ ive an education , including his dau@@ gh@@ ters , despite the T@@ ali@@ ban , despite the risks .
To him , there was greater risk in not educ@@ ating his children .
Dur@@ ing T@@ ali@@ ban years , I remember there were times I would get so frustr@@ ated by our life and always being scar@@ ed and not seeing a future .
I would want to qu@@ it , but my father , he would say , &quot; L@@ isten , my daughter , you can lose everything you own in your life .
Your money can be st@@ ol@@ en . You can be forced to leave your home during a war .
But the one thing that will always remain with you is what is here , and if we have to sell our blood to pay your school fe@@ es , we will .
So do you still not want to continue ? &quot;
Today I am 22 .
I was raised in a country that has been destro@@ yed by decades of war .
Fe@@ wer than six percent of women my age have made it beyond high school , and had my family not been so commit@@ ted to my education , I would be one of them .
Instead , I stand here a proud graduate of Mid@@ d@@ le@@ bu@@ ry Col@@ le@@ ge .
When I re@@ turned to Afghanistan , my grand@@ father , the one ex@@ il@@ ed from his home for dar@@ ing to educ@@ ate his dau@@ gh@@ ters , was among the first to con@@ grat@@ ul@@ ate me .
He not only br@@ ags about my college degree , but also that I was the first woman , and that I am the first woman to drive him through the streets of K@@ ab@@ u@@ l .
My family believ@@ es in me .
I dream big , but my family dreams even bigger for me .
That &apos;s why I am a global amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ or for 10@@ x@@ 10 , a global campaign to educ@@ ate women .
That &apos;s why I co@@ f@@ ounded S@@ O@@ LA , the first and perhaps only bo@@ ar@@ ding school for girls in Afghanistan , a country where it &apos;s still ris@@ ky for girls to go to school .
The exciting thing is that I see students at my school with ambi@@ tion gr@@ ab@@ bing at opportunity .
And I see their parents and their fa@@ thers who , like my own , ad@@ voc@@ ate for them , despite and even in the face of dau@@ n@@ ting op@@ position .
Like A@@ h@@ med . That &apos;s not his real name , and I cannot show you his face , but A@@ h@@ med is the father of one of my students .
L@@ ess than a month ago , he and his daughter were on their way from S@@ O@@ LA to their village , and they literally miss@@ ed being killed by a ro@@ ad@@ side bom@@ b by minutes .
As he arrived home , the phone ran@@ g , a voice war@@ ning him that if he sent his daughter back to school , they would try again .
&quot; K@@ ill me now , if you wish , &quot; he said , &quot; but I will not ru@@ in my daughter &apos;s future because of your old and back@@ ward ideas . &quot;
What I &apos;ve come to realize about Afghanistan , and this is something that is often dis@@ miss@@ ed in the West , that behind most of us who succe@@ ed is a father who recogni@@ zes the value in his daughter and who sees that her success is his success .
It &apos;s not to say that our mothers aren &apos;t key in our success .
In fact , they &apos;re often the initi@@ al and convinc@@ ing negoti@@ ators of a bright future for their dau@@ gh@@ ters , but in the context of a society like in Afghanistan , we must have the support of men .
Un@@ der the T@@ ali@@ ban , girls who went to school num@@ ber@@ ed in the hundreds -- remember , it was il@@ legal .
But today , more than three million girls are in school in Afghanistan .
Afghanistan looks so different from here in America .
I find that Americans see the frag@@ il@@ ity in changes .
I fear that these changes will not last much beyond the U.S. tro@@ ops &apos; with@@ dra@@ w@@ al .
But when I am back in Afghanistan , when I see the students in my school and their parents who ad@@ voc@@ ate for them , who encourage them , I see a prom@@ is@@ ing future and las@@ ting change .
To me , Afghanistan is a country of hope and b@@ ound@@ less possibilities , and every single day the girls of S@@ O@@ LA re@@ mind me of that .
Like me , they are dre@@ aming big .
Thank you .
I have never , ever for@@ gotten the words of my grandmother who died in her ex@@ ile : &quot; Son , res@@ ist G@@ add@@ af@@ i . F@@ ight him .
But don &apos;t you ever turn into a G@@ add@@ a@@ fi@@ -@@ like re@@ volu@@ tionary . &quot;
Al@@ most two years have passed since the Li@@ by@@ an R@@ evolution broke out , inspired by the waves of mass mobi@@ liz@@ ation in both the T@@ un@@ is@@ ian and the Egyp@@ tian re@@ volu@@ tions .
I jo@@ ined forces with many other Li@@ by@@ ans inside and outside Li@@ b@@ ya to call for a day of r@@ age and to initi@@ ate a revolution against the ty@@ r@@ ann@@ ical regi@@ me of G@@ add@@ af@@ i .
And there it was , a great revolution .
Y@@ oun@@ g Li@@ by@@ an women and men were at the fore@@ front calling for the fall of the regi@@ me , rais@@ ing s@@ log@@ ans of freedom , dign@@ ity , social justice .
They have shown an ex@@ empl@@ ary br@@ av@@ ery in confron@@ ting the bru@@ tal dic@@ tat@@ or@@ ship of G@@ add@@ af@@ i .
They have shown a great sense of soli@@ dar@@ ity from the far e@@ ast to the far west to the south .
E@@ ven@@ tually , after a period of six months of bru@@ tal war and a tol@@ l rate of almost 5@@ 0,000 dead , we managed to liber@@ ate our country and to top@@ ple the ty@@ rant .
However , G@@ add@@ af@@ i left behind a heavy bur@@ den , a leg@@ acy of ty@@ r@@ anny , corruption and see@@ ds of diver@@ sions .
For four decades G@@ add@@ af@@ i &apos;s ty@@ r@@ ann@@ ical regi@@ me destro@@ yed the infrastructure as well as the culture and the moral fabri@@ c of Li@@ by@@ an society .
A@@ ware of the dev@@ as@@ tation and the challenges , I was ke@@ en among many other women to re@@ build the Li@@ by@@ an civil society , calling for an inclu@@ sive and just transition to democracy and national re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation .
Al@@ most 200 organizations were establ@@ ished in Ben@@ gh@@ az@@ i during and immediately after the fall of G@@ add@@ af@@ i -- almost 300 in T@@ ri@@ pol@@ i .
After a period of 33 years in ex@@ ile , I went back to Li@@ b@@ ya , and with unique en@@ thu@@ sias@@ m , I started organiz@@ ing work@@ sh@@ ops on capacity building , on human development of leadership skills .
With an amazing group of women , I co-@@ f@@ ounded the Li@@ by@@ an Women &apos;s Pl@@ at@@ form for P@@ ea@@ ce , a movement of women , leaders , from different wal@@ ks of life , to lob@@ by for the soci@@ o@@ political em@@ power@@ ment of women and to lob@@ by for our right for equal participation in building democracy and peace .
I met a very difficult environment in the pre-@@ elec@@ tions , an environment which was increasingly pol@@ ar@@ ized , an environment which was shap@@ ed by the sel@@ fish politics of domin@@ ance and exclu@@ sion .
I led an initi@@ ative by the Li@@ by@@ an Women &apos;s Pl@@ at@@ form for P@@ ea@@ ce to lob@@ by for a more inclu@@ sive el@@ ect@@ oral law , a law that would give every citiz@@ en , no matter what your background , the right to vote and run , and most importantly to sti@@ pul@@ ate on political parties the altern@@ ation of male and female candi@@ dat@@ es ver@@ tically and horiz@@ on@@ t@@ ally in their l@@ ists , creating the z@@ i@@ p@@ per list .
E@@ ven@@ tually , our initi@@ ative was adop@@ ted and successful .
Women won 17@@ .@@ 5 percent of the National Congr@@ ess in the first elec@@ tions ever in 5@@ 2 years .
However , bit by bit , the eu@@ ph@@ ori@@ a of the elec@@ tions , and of the revolution as a whole , was f@@ ad@@ ing out -- for every day we were w@@ aking up to the news of violence .
One day we wake up to the news of the des@@ ec@@ r@@ ation of ancient mo@@ s@@ ques and Su@@ f@@ i tomb@@ s .
On another day we wake up to the news of the mur@@ der of the American amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ or and the attack on the consul@@ ate .
On another day we wake up to the news of the ass@@ ass@@ ination of ar@@ my off@@ ic@@ ers .
And every day , every day we wake up with the rule of the mi@@ li@@ ti@@ as and their continu@@ ous viol@@ ations of human rights of pris@@ on@@ ers and their dis@@ respect of the rule of law .
Our society , shap@@ ed by a re@@ volu@@ tionary min@@ d@@ set , became more pol@@ ar@@ ized and has driven away from the ide@@ als and the principles -- freedom , dign@@ ity , social justice -- that we first held .
In@@ tol@@ er@@ ance , exclu@@ sion and reven@@ ge became the ic@@ ons of the &#91; after@@ math &#93; of the revolution .
I am here today not at all to inspire you with our success story of the z@@ i@@ p@@ per list and the elec@@ tions .
I &apos;m rather here today to conf@@ ess that we as a nation took the wrong choice , made the wrong decision .
We did not pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ ze right .
For elec@@ tions did not bring peace and st@@ ability and security in Li@@ b@@ ya .
Did the z@@ i@@ p@@ per list and the altern@@ ation between female and male candi@@ dat@@ es bring peace and national re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation ?
No , it didn &apos;t .
What is it , then ?
Why does our society continue to be pol@@ ar@@ ized and domin@@ ated with sel@@ fish politics of domin@@ ance and exclu@@ sion , by both men and women ?
Maybe what was missing was not the women only , but the fem@@ in@@ ine values of compassion , mer@@ cy and inclu@@ sion .
Our society needs national dialogue and con@@ sen@@ su@@ s-@@ building more than it needed the elec@@ tions , which only re@@ in@@ forced pol@@ ar@@ ization and di@@ vision .
Our society needs the qu@@ al@@ it@@ ative repres@@ entation of the fem@@ in@@ ine more than it needs the nu@@ mer@@ ical , quantit@@ ative repres@@ entation of the fem@@ in@@ ine .
We need to stop acting as agents of r@@ age and calling for days of r@@ age .
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mer@@ cy .
We need to develop a fem@@ in@@ ine dis@@ course that not only hon@@ ors but also impl@@ ements mer@@ cy instead of reven@@ ge , collaboration instead of competition , inclu@@ sion instead of exclu@@ sion .
These are the ide@@ als that a war@@ -@@ tor@@ n Li@@ b@@ ya needs des@@ per@@ ately in order to achieve peace .
For peace has an al@@ chem@@ y , and this al@@ chem@@ y is about the inter@@ tw@@ in@@ ing , the altern@@ ation between the fem@@ in@@ ine and mas@@ cul@@ ine perspec@@ tives .
That &apos;s the real z@@ i@@ p@@ per .
And we need to establ@@ ish that exis@@ tenti@@ ally before we do so soci@@ o@@ poli@@ tically .
Ac@@ cor@@ ding to a Qu@@ ran@@ ic verse &quot; Sal@@ am &quot; -- peace -- &quot; is the word of the all@@ -@@ mer@@ ci@@ ful God , ra@@ he@@ em . &quot;
In turn , the word &quot; ra@@ he@@ em , &quot; which is known in all A@@ br@@ ah@@ am@@ ic traditions , has the same ro@@ ot in Arab@@ ic as the word &quot; ra@@ h@@ em &quot; -- wom@@ b -- symbo@@ liz@@ ing the matern@@ al fem@@ in@@ ine en@@ comp@@ ass@@ ing all humanity from which the male and the female , from which all tri@@ bes , all pe@@ op@@ les , have em@@ an@@ ated from .
And so just as the wom@@ b entirely envelop@@ es the embr@@ y@@ o , which gro@@ ws within it , the div@@ ine ma@@ tri@@ x of compassion nour@@ ish@@ es the entire existence .
Th@@ us we are told that &quot; My mer@@ cy en@@ compas@@ ses all things . &quot;
Th@@ us we are told that &quot; My mer@@ cy takes pre@@ ce@@ dence over my anger . &quot;
M@@ ay we all be gran@@ ted a gr@@ ace of mer@@ cy .
Thank you .
I &apos;m here today to talk about a dis@@ tur@@ bing question , which has an equ@@ ally dis@@ tur@@ bing answer .
My top@@ ic is the secrets of domes@@ tic violence , and the question I &apos;m going to t@@ ack@@ le is the one question everyone always asks : Why does she stay ?
Why would anyone stay with a man who be@@ ats her ?
I &apos;m not a psychi@@ atr@@ ist , a social wor@@ ker or an expert in domes@@ tic violence .
I &apos;m just one woman with a story to tell .
I was 22 . I had just gradu@@ ated from Harvard Col@@ le@@ ge .
I had moved to New York City for my first job as a writer and ed@@ it@@ or at S@@ ev@@ ent@@ een magazine .
I had my first ap@@ art@@ ment , my first little green American Ex@@ press card , and I had a very big secret .
My secret was that I had this gun lo@@ aded with hol@@ low-@@ point bul@@ lets poin@@ ted at my head by the man who I thought was my sou@@ l@@ mate , many , many times .
The man who I loved more than anybody on Earth held a gun to my head and threat@@ en@@ ed to kill me more times than I can even remember .
I &apos;m here to tell you the story of crazy love , a psycho@@ logical tra@@ p dis@@ gu@@ is@@ ed as love , one that millions of women and even a few men fall into every year .
It may even be your story .
I don &apos;t look like a typical domes@@ tic violence surviv@@ or .
I have a B@@ .@@ A. in English from Harvard Col@@ le@@ ge , an M@@ B@@ A in marketing from Wh@@ ar@@ ton B@@ us@@ iness School .
I &apos;ve spent most of my career working for For@@ tune 500 companies including John@@ son &amp; amp ; John@@ son , Le@@ o Bur@@ net@@ t and The Washington Po@@ st .
I &apos;ve been married for almost 20 years to my second husband and we have three kids together .
My dog is a black lab , and I drive a H@@ ond@@ a O@@ dy@@ s@@ sey min@@ iv@@ an .
So my first message for you is that domes@@ tic violence happens to everyone -- all rac@@ es , all religi@@ ons , all income and education levels .
It &apos;s everywhere .
And my second message is that everyone thinks domes@@ tic violence happens to women , that it &apos;s a women &apos;s issue .
Not exactly .
Over 85 percent of ab@@ users are men , and domes@@ tic ab@@ use happens only in in@@ timate , inter@@ dependent , long-term relationships , in other words , in families , the last place we would want or expect to find violence , which is one reason domes@@ tic ab@@ use is so conf@@ using .
I would have told you myself that I was the last person on Earth who would stay with a man who be@@ ats me , but in fact I was a very typical victi@@ m because of my age .
I was 22 , and in the United States , women ages 16 to 24 are three times as likely to be domes@@ tic violence victims as women of other ages , and over 500 women and girls this age are killed every year by ab@@ u@@ sive part@@ ners , bo@@ y@@ friends , and hus@@ ban@@ ds in the United States .
I was also a very typical victi@@ m because I knew nothing about domes@@ tic violence , its war@@ ning signs or its patterns .
I met Con@@ or on a cold , rain@@ y Jan@@ u@@ ary night .
He sat next to me on the New York City sub@@ way , and he started ch@@ at@@ ting me up .
He told me two things .
One was that he , too , had just gradu@@ ated from an I@@ v@@ y Le@@ ague school , and that he worked at a very impres@@ sive W@@ all Street bank .
But what made the biggest impression on me that first meeting was that he was smart and funny and he looked like a farm boy .
He had these big che@@ e@@ ks , these big app@@ le che@@ e@@ ks and this whe@@ at@@ -@@ bl@@ ond hair , and he seemed so swe@@ et .
One of the smar@@ test things Con@@ or did , from the very beginning , was to create the illusion that I was the domin@@ ant partner in the relationship .
He did this especially at the beginning by i@@ do@@ liz@@ ing me .
We started d@@ ating , and he loved everything about me , that I was smart , that I &apos;d gone to Harvard , that I was passionate about helping teen@@ age girls , and my job .
He wanted to know everything about my family and my childhood and my hop@@ es and dreams .
Con@@ or believed in me , as a writer and a woman , in a way that no one else ever had .
And he also created a mag@@ ical atmosphere of trust between us by conf@@ essing his secret , which was that , as a very young boy starting at age four , he had been sav@@ ag@@ ely and repe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly physi@@ cally ab@@ used by his ste@@ p@@ father , and the ab@@ use had gotten so bad that he had had to drop out of school in e@@ igh@@ th grade , even though he was very smart , and he &apos;d spent almost 20 years re@@ building his life .
Which is why that I@@ v@@ y Le@@ ague degree and the W@@ all Street job and his bright sh@@ in@@ y future meant so much to him .
If you had told me that this smart , funny , sensitive man who ado@@ red me would one day dic@@ t@@ ate whether or not I w@@ ore ma@@ k@@ eu@@ p , how short my sk@@ ir@@ ts were , where I lived , what jobs I took , who my friends were and where I spent Christ@@ mas , I would have laugh@@ ed at you , because there was not a h@@ int of violence or control or anger in Con@@ or at the beginning .
I didn &apos;t know that the first stage in any domes@@ tic violence relationship is to se@@ duce and char@@ m the victi@@ m .
I also didn &apos;t know that the second step is to isol@@ ate the victi@@ m .
Now , Con@@ or did not come home one day and ann@@ oun@@ ce , &quot; You know , h@@ ey , all this Rom@@ e@@ o and Juli@@ et stuff has been great , but I need to move into the next phase where I isol@@ ate you and I ab@@ use you &quot; — — &quot; so I need to get you out of this ap@@ art@@ ment where the neighb@@ ors can hear you scre@@ am and out of this city where you have friends and family and co@@ workers who can see the bru@@ ises . &quot;
Instead , Con@@ or came home one Fri@@ day even@@ ing and he told me that he had qu@@ it his job that day , his dream job , and he said that he had qu@@ it his job because of me , because I had made him feel so safe and loved that he didn &apos;t need to prove himself on W@@ all Street anymore , and he just wanted to get out of the city and away from his ab@@ u@@ sive , dy@@ s@@ func@@ tional family ,
and move to a tiny town in New England where he could start his life over with me by his side .
Now , the last thing I wanted to do was leave New York , and my dream job , but I thought you made sacri@@ fices for your sou@@ l@@ mate , so I agre@@ ed , and I qu@@ it my job , and Con@@ or and I left Manhattan together .
I had no idea I was fall@@ ing into crazy love , that I was walking head@@ first into a carefully l@@ aid physical , financial and psycho@@ logical tra@@ p .
The next step in the domes@@ tic violence pattern is to introduce the threat of violence and see how she re@@ acts .
And here &apos;s where those g@@ uns come in .
As soon as we moved to New England -- you know , that place where Con@@ nor was supposed to feel so safe -- he bought three g@@ uns .
He kept one in the g@@ love com@@ partment of our car .
He kept one under the pil@@ lows on our bed , and the third one he kept in his po@@ cket at all times .
And he said that he needed those g@@ uns because of the trau@@ ma he &apos;d experienced as a young boy .
He needed them to feel protected .
But those g@@ uns were really a message for me , and even though he hadn &apos;t raised a hand to me , my life was already in grave danger every minute of every day .
Con@@ or first physi@@ cally att@@ acked me five days before our we@@ d@@ ding .
It was 7 a@@ .@@ m@@ . I still had on my ni@@ ght@@ go@@ wn .
I was working on my computer trying to finish a fre@@ el@@ ance writing as@@ sign@@ ment , and I got frustr@@ ated , and Con@@ or used my anger as an ex@@ cu@@ se to put both of his hands around my nec@@ k and to squ@@ e@@ e@@ ze so ti@@ ghtly that I could not brea@@ the or scre@@ am , and he used the cho@@ ke@@ hold to hit my head repe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly against the wall .
F@@ ive days later , the ten bru@@ ises on my nec@@ k had just f@@ aded , and I put on my mother &apos;s we@@ d@@ ding d@@ ress , and I married him .
D@@ esp@@ ite what had happened , I was sure we were going to live happ@@ ily ever after , because I loved him , and he loved me so much .
And he was very , very sorry .
He had just been really str@@ essed out by the we@@ d@@ ding and by becoming a family with me .
It was an isol@@ ated in@@ cident , and he was never going to hur@@ t me again .
It happened twice more on the hon@@ ey@@ moon .
The first time , I was driving to find a secret be@@ ach and I got lost , and he pun@@ ched me in the side of my head so hard that the other side of my head repe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly hit the driver &apos;s side window .
And then a few days later , driving home from our hon@@ ey@@ moon , he got frustr@@ ated by traffic , and he thre@@ w a cold Big Ma@@ c in my face .
Con@@ or proce@@ e@@ ded to beat me once or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage .
I was mis@@ taken in thinking that I was unique and alone in this situation .
One in three American women experiences domes@@ tic violence or st@@ al@@ king at some point in her life , and the C@@ D@@ C re@@ ports that 15 million children are ab@@ used every year , 15 million .
So actually , I was in very good company .
B@@ ack to my question : Why did I stay ?
The answer is easy .
I didn &apos;t know he was ab@@ using me .
Even though he held those lo@@ aded g@@ uns to my head , push@@ ed me down st@@ airs , threat@@ en@@ ed to kill our dog , pul@@ led the key out of the car ig@@ ni@@ tion as I dro@@ ve down the high@@ way , pou@@ red coffee gr@@ in@@ ds on my head as I dr@@ essed for a job interview , I never once thought of myself as a batter@@ ed wife .
Instead , I was a very strong woman in love with a deeply trou@@ bl@@ ed man , and I was the only person on Earth who could help Con@@ or face his dem@@ ons .
The other question everybody asks is , why doesn &apos;t she just leave ?
Why didn &apos;t I walk out ? I could have left any time .
To me , this is the s@@ add@@ est and most pain@@ ful question that people ask , because we victims know something you usually don &apos;t : It &apos;s incredibly dangerous to leave an ab@@ user .
Because the final step in the domes@@ tic violence pattern is kill her .
Over 70 percent of domes@@ tic violence mur@@ ders happen after the victi@@ m has ended the relationship , after she &apos;s gotten out , because then the ab@@ user has nothing left to lose .
O@@ ther out@@ comes include long-term st@@ al@@ king , even after the ab@@ user remar@@ ries ; den@@ ial of financial resources ; and manipul@@ ation of the family court system to terri@@ fy the victi@@ m and her children , who are regul@@ arly forced by family court jud@@ ges to spend un@@ super@@ vis@@ ed time with the man who beat their mother .
And still we ask , why doesn &apos;t she just leave ?
I was able to leave , because of one final , sa@@ dis@@ tic be@@ ating that broke through my den@@ ial .
I realized that the man who I loved so much was going to kill me if I let him .
So I broke the silence .
I told everyone : the police , my neighb@@ ors , my friends and family , total str@@ angers , and I &apos;m here today because you all helped me .
We tend to st@@ ere@@ oty@@ pe victims as gr@@ is@@ ly head@@ lines , self-@@ destruc@@ tive women , dam@@ aged go@@ ods .
The question , &quot; Why does she stay ? &quot;
is code for some people for , &quot; It &apos;s her fau@@ lt for st@@ aying , &quot; as if victims in@@ tenti@@ on@@ ally choose to fall in love with men int@@ ent upon destro@@ ying us .
But since publ@@ ishing &quot; C@@ ra@@ z@@ y Lo@@ ve , &quot; I have heard hundreds of stories from men and women who also got out , who learned an inv@@ alu@@ able life lesson from what happened , and who re@@ built lives -- jo@@ y@@ ous , happy lives -- as employ@@ ees , wi@@ ves and mothers , lives completely free of violence , like me .
Because it turns out that I &apos;m actually a very typical domes@@ tic violence victi@@ m and a typical domes@@ tic violence surviv@@ or .
I remar@@ ried a kind and gent@@ le man , and we have those three kids .
I have that black lab , and I have that min@@ iv@@ an .
What I will never have again , ever , is a lo@@ aded gun held to my head by someone who says that he lo@@ ves me .
Right now , maybe you &apos;re thinking , &quot; Wow , this is fascinating , &quot; or , &quot; Wow , how stupid was she , &quot; but this whole time , I &apos;ve actually been talking about you .
I promise you there are several people listening to me right now who are currently being ab@@ used or who were ab@@ used as children or who are ab@@ users themselves .
A@@ bu@@ se could be aff@@ ecting your daughter , your sister , your best friend right now .
I was able to end my own crazy love story by breaking the silence .
I &apos;m still breaking the silence today .
It &apos;s my way of helping other victims , and it &apos;s my final requ@@ est of you .
Talk about what you heard here .
A@@ bu@@ se th@@ ri@@ ves only in silence .
You have the power to end domes@@ tic violence simply by sh@@ in@@ ing a spo@@ t@@ light on it .
We victims need everyone .
We need every one of you to understand the secrets of domes@@ tic violence .
S@@ how ab@@ use the light of day by talking about it with your children , your co@@ workers , your friends and family .
R@@ ec@@ ast surviv@@ ors as wonderful , lo@@ v@@ able people with full fu@@ tures .
R@@ eco@@ g@@ ni@@ ze the early signs of violence and con@@ scienti@@ ously inter@@ ven@@ e , de@@ es@@ cal@@ ate it , show victims a safe way out .
To@@ gether we can make our be@@ ds , our dinner tables and our families the safe and pe@@ ace@@ ful o@@ ases they should be .
Thank you .
H@@ i . My name is Cam@@ er@@ on Rus@@ sell , and for the last little while , I &apos;ve been a model .
Actually , for 10 years .
And I feel like there &apos;s an un@@ comfortable tension in the room right now because I should not have wor@@ n this d@@ ress . So lu@@ ck@@ ily , I brought an out@@ fit change .
This is the first out@@ fit change on the TED stage , so you guys are pretty lucky to wit@@ ness it , I think .
If some of the women were really horri@@ fied when I came out , you don &apos;t have to tell me now , but I &apos;ll find out later on Twitter .
I &apos;d also note that I &apos;m quite privil@@ eg@@ ed to be able to transform what you think of me in a very bri@@ ef 10 seconds .
Not everybody gets to do that .
These he@@ els are very un@@ comfortable , so good thing I wasn &apos;t going to wear them .
The worst part is putting this swe@@ ater over my head , because that &apos;s when you &apos;ll all l@@ augh at me , so don &apos;t do anything while it &apos;s over my head .
All right .
So , why did I do that ?
That was aw@@ k@@ ward .
Well -- H@@ op@@ efully not as aw@@ k@@ ward as that picture .
I@@ mage is powerful , but also , image is super@@ fici@@ al .
I just totally transform@@ ed what you thought of me , in six seconds .
And in this picture , I had actually never had a bo@@ y@@ friend in real life .
I was totally un@@ comfortable , and the photograp@@ her was telling me to ar@@ ch my back and put my hand in that guy &apos;s hair .
And of course , b@@ arr@@ ing surgery , or the fa@@ ke t@@ an that I got two days ago for work , there &apos;s very little that we can do to transform how we look , and how we look , though it is super@@ fici@@ al and im@@ mu@@ table , has a huge impact on our lives .
So today , for me , being f@@ ear@@ less means being honest .
And I am on this stage because I am a model .
I am on this stage because I am a pretty , white woman , and in my industry , we call that a sex@@ y girl .
I &apos;m going to answer the questions that people always ask me , but with an honest tw@@ ist .
So the first question is , how do you become a model ?
I always just say , &quot; Oh , I was s@@ cou@@ ted , &quot; but that means nothing .
The real way that I became a model is I won a genetic l@@ ot@@ tery , and I am the reci@@ pi@@ ent of a leg@@ acy , and maybe you &apos;re wondering what is a leg@@ acy .
Well , for the past few centu@@ ries we have defined beauty not just as health and y@@ ou@@ th and symme@@ try that we &apos;re biolog@@ ically program@@ med to ad@@ mi@@ re , but also as t@@ all , sl@@ ender figures , and fem@@ in@@ in@@ ity and white skin .
And this is a leg@@ acy that was built for me , and it &apos;s a leg@@ acy that I &apos;ve been cas@@ h@@ ing out on .
And I know there are people in the audience who are s@@ ke@@ p@@ tical at this point , and maybe there are some fashi@@ on@@ ist@@ as who are like , &quot; W@@ ait . N@@ a@@ om@@ i . Ty@@ ra . Jo@@ an Sm@@ alls . Li@@ u W@@ en . &quot;
And first , I comm@@ end you on your model knowledge . Very impres@@ sive .
But unfortunately , I have to in@@ form you that in 2007 , a very inspired N@@ Y@@ U Ph@@ .@@ D@@ . student coun@@ ted all the models on the run@@ way , every single one that was hi@@ red , and of the 6@@ 7@@ 7 models that were hi@@ red , only 27 , or less than four percent , were non-@@ white .
The next question people always ask is , &quot; Can I be a model when I grow up ? &quot;
And the first answer is , &quot; I don &apos;t know , they don &apos;t put me in charge of that . &quot;
But the second answer , and what I really want to say to these little girls is , &quot; Why ? You know ? You can be anything .
You could be the President of the United States , or the invent@@ or of the next Internet , or a n@@ inj@@ a cardi@@ o@@ th@@ or@@ ac@@ ic surge@@ on po@@ et , which would be awesome , because you &apos;d be the first one . &quot;
If , after this amazing list , they still are like , &quot; No , no , Cam@@ er@@ on , I want to be a model , &quot; well , then I say , &quot; B@@ e my bo@@ ss . &quot;
Because I &apos;m not in charge of anything , and you could be the ed@@ it@@ or in chi@@ ef of American Vo@@ gue or the CE@@ O of H &amp; amp ; M , or the next St@@ even Me@@ is@@ el .
S@@ aying that you want to be a model when you grow up is ak@@ in to saying that you want to win the Po@@ wer@@ ball when you grow up .
It &apos;s out of your control , and it &apos;s awesome , and it &apos;s not a career path .
I will demonstr@@ ate for you now 10 years of accumul@@ ated model knowledge , because un@@ like cardi@@ o@@ th@@ or@@ ac@@ ic surge@@ ons , it can just be dis@@ til@@ led right now .
So , if the photograp@@ her is right there , the light is right there , like a nice H@@ M@@ I , and the client says , &quot; We want a walking shot , &quot; this leg goes first , nice and long , this arm goes back , this arm goes forward , the head is at three quar@@ ters , and you just go back and forth , just do that , and then you look back at your imagin@@ ary friends , 300 , 400 , 500 times .
It will look something like this . H@@ op@@ efully less aw@@ k@@ ward than that one in the middle .
That was -- I don &apos;t know what happened there .
Un@@ fortunately , after you &apos;ve gone to school , and you have a ré@@ sum@@ é and you &apos;ve done a few jobs , you can &apos;t say anything anymore , so if you say you want to be the President of the United States , but your ré@@ sum@@ é re@@ ads , &quot; Un@@ der@@ wear Mo@@ del : 10 years , &quot; people give you a funny look .
The next question is , &quot; Do they re@@ touch all the photos ? &quot;
And yeah , they pretty much re@@ touch all the photos , but that is only a small compon@@ ent of what &apos;s happening .
This picture is the very first picture that I ever took , and it &apos;s also the very first time that I had wor@@ n a bi@@ kin@@ i , and I didn &apos;t even have my period yet .
I know we &apos;re getting personal , but I was a young girl .
This is what I looked like with my grand@@ ma just a few months earlier .
Here &apos;s me on the same day as this sho@@ ot .
My friend got to come .
Here &apos;s me at a slu@@ m@@ ber party a few days before I shot French Vo@@ gue .
Here &apos;s me on the so@@ c@@ cer team and in V Mag@@ az@@ ine .
And here &apos;s me today .
And I hope what you &apos;re seeing is that these pictures are not pictures of me .
They are construc@@ tions , and they are construc@@ tions by a group of professi@@ on@@ als , by h@@ air@@ sty@@ l@@ ists and ma@@ k@@ eu@@ p artists and photograph@@ ers and sty@@ l@@ ists and all of their ass@@ ist@@ ants and pre-@@ production and post-@@ production , and they build this . That &apos;s not me .
Okay , so the next question people always ask me is , &quot; Do you get free stuff ? &quot;
I do have too many 8@@ -@@ in@@ ch he@@ els which I never get to wear , except for earlier , but the free stuff that I get is the free stuff that I get in real life , and that &apos;s what we don &apos;t like to talk about .
I grew up in Cam@@ bridge , and one time I went into a store and I for@@ got my money and they gave me the d@@ ress for free .
When I was a teen@@ ager , I was driving with my friend who was an awful driver and she ran a red and of course , we got pul@@ led over , and all it took was a &quot; S@@ or@@ ry , off@@ ic@@ er , &quot; and we were on our way .
And I got these free things because of how I look , not who I am , and there are people paying a cost for how they look and not who they are .
I live in New York , and last year , of the 14@@ 0,000 teen@@ agers that were stopped and fr@@ is@@ ked , 8@@ 6 % of them were black and L@@ at@@ ino , and most of them were young men .
And there are only 17@@ 7@@ ,000 young black and L@@ at@@ ino men in New York , so for them , it &apos;s not a question of , &quot; Will I get stopped ? &quot;
but &quot; How many times will I get stopped ? When will I get stopped ? &quot;
When I was resear@@ ching this talk , I found out that of the 1@@ 3@@ -year-old girls in the United States , 5@@ 3 % don &apos;t like their bodies , and that number goes to 7@@ 8 % by the time that they &apos;re 17 .
So , the last question people ask me is , &quot; What is it like to be a model ? &quot;
And I think the answer that they &apos;re looking for is , &quot; If you are a little bit sk@@ in@@ ni@@ er and you have sh@@ in@@ ier hair , you will be so happy and fabul@@ ous . &quot;
And when we &apos;re back@@ stage , we give an answer that maybe makes it seem like that .
We say , &quot; It &apos;s really amazing to travel , and it &apos;s amazing to get to work with creative , inspired , passionate people . &quot;
And those things are true , but they &apos;re only one half of the story , because the thing that we never say on camera , that I have never said on camera , is , &quot; I am insec@@ ure . &quot;
And I &apos;m insec@@ ure because I have to think about what I look like every day .
And if you ever are wondering , &quot; If I have thin@@ ner th@@ igh@@ s and sh@@ in@@ ier hair , will I be happ@@ ier ? &quot;
you just need to meet a group of models , because they have the thin@@ n@@ est th@@ igh@@ s , the sh@@ ini@@ est hair and the co@@ ol@@ est clo@@ thes , and they &apos;re the most physi@@ cally insec@@ ure women probably on the planet .
When I was writing this talk , I found it very difficult to stri@@ ke an honest balance , because on the one hand , I felt very un@@ comfortable to come out here and say , &quot; Look I &apos;ve received all these benefits from a dec@@ k stac@@ ked in my fav@@ or , &quot; and it also felt really un@@ comfortable to follow that up with , &quot; and it doesn &apos;t always make me happy . &quot;
But mostly it was difficult to un@@ p@@ ack a leg@@ acy of gender and rac@@ ial op@@ pression when I am one of the biggest bene@@ fici@@ aries .
But I &apos;m also happy and hon@@ o@@ red to be up here and I think that it &apos;s great that I got to come before 10 or 20 or 30 years had passed and I &apos;d had more ag@@ ency in my career , because maybe then I wouldn &apos;t tell the story of how I got my first job , or maybe I wouldn &apos;t tell the story of how I paid for college , which seems so important right now .
If there &apos;s a ta@@ k@@ ea@@ way to this talk , I hope it &apos;s that we all feel more comfortable ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ging the power of image in our perce@@ ived succ@@ esses and our perce@@ ived failu@@ res .
Thank you .
Ph@@ ot@@ ograph@@ y has been my passion ever since I was old enough to pick up a camera , but today I want to share with you the 15 most tre@@ a@@ su@@ red photos of mine , and I didn &apos;t take any of them .
There were no art direc@@ tors , no sty@@ l@@ ists , no chance for res@@ ho@@ ots , not even any regard for li@@ ghting .
In fact , most of them were taken by random tour@@ ists .
My story begins when I was in New York City for a speaking engagement , and my wife took this picture of me holding my daughter on her first bir@@ th@@ day . We &apos;re on the corner of 5@@ 7@@ th and 5@@ th .
We happened to be back in New York exactly a year later , so we decided to take the same picture .
Well you can see where this is going .
Ap@@ pro@@ ach@@ ing my daughter &apos;s third bir@@ th@@ day , my wife said , &quot; Hey , why don &apos;t you take S@@ ab@@ ina back to New York and make it a fa@@ ther@@ -@@ daughter trip , and continue the ritu@@ al ? &quot;
This is when we started asking pass@@ ing tour@@ ists to take the picture .
You know , it &apos;s remarkable how universal the ges@@ ture is of h@@ anding your camera to a total str@@ anger .
No one &apos;s ever ref@@ used , and lu@@ ck@@ ily no one &apos;s ever run off with our camera .
B@@ ack then , we had no idea how much this trip would change our lives .
It &apos;s really become sac@@ red to us .
This one was taken just weeks after 9 / 11 , and I found myself trying to explain what had happened that day in ways a fi@@ ve@@ -year-old could understand .
So these photos are far more than pro@@ x@@ ies for a single moment , or even a specific trip .
They &apos;re also ways for us to free@@ ze time for one week in Oc@@ to@@ ber and refl@@ ect on our times and how we change from year to year , and not just physi@@ cally , but in every way .
Because while we take the same photo , our perspec@@ tives change , and she re@@ aches new mil@@ est@@ ones , and I get to see life through her eyes , and how she inter@@ acts with and sees everything .
This very focused time we get to spend together is something we cher@@ ish and anticip@@ ate the entire year .
R@@ ec@@ ently , on one trip , we were walking , and she stop@@ s dead in her tr@@ acks , and she points to a red aw@@ ning of the dol@@ l store that she loved when she was little on our earlier tri@@ ps .
And she descri@@ bes to me the feeling she felt as a fi@@ ve@@ -year-old standing in that exact spot .
She said she rem@@ em@@ bers her heart bur@@ sting out of her ch@@ est when she saw that place for the very first time nine years earlier .
And now what she &apos;s looking at in New York are colle@@ ges , because she &apos;s determin@@ ed to go to school in New York .
And it hit me : One of the most important things we all make are mem@@ ories .
So I want to share the idea of taking an active role in consci@@ ously creating mem@@ ories .
I don &apos;t know about you , but as@@ ide from these 15 sh@@ ots , I &apos;m not in many of the family photos .
I &apos;m always the one taking the picture .
So I want to encourage everyone today to get in the shot , and don &apos;t h@@ es@@ it@@ ate to go up to someone and ask , &quot; Will you take our picture ? &quot;
Thank you .
I would like to talk to you about a very special group of animals .
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world .
V@@ ul@@ tures are am@@ ong@@ st the most threat@@ en@@ ed group of birds .
When you see a vul@@ ture like this , the first thing that comes to your mind is , these are dis@@ gu@@ sting , u@@ g@@ ly , gre@@ e@@ dy creatures that are just after your fl@@ esh , associated with politicians . I want to change that perception . I want to change those feelings you have for these birds , because they need our symp@@ ath@@ y . They really do . And I &apos;ll tell you why .
First of all , why do they have such a bad press ?
When Charles Darwin went across the Atlan@@ tic in 18@@ 32 on the Be@@ ag@@ le , he saw the tur@@ key vul@@ ture , and he said , &quot; These are dis@@ gu@@ sting birds with bal@@ d scar@@ let heads that are formed to re@@ v@@ el in pu@@ tri@@ d@@ ity . &quot; You could not get a worse insul@@ t , and that from Charles Darwin . You know , he changed his mind when he came back , and I &apos;ll tell you why .
They &apos;ve also be associated with Dis@@ ney — — person@@ i@@ fied as go@@ of@@ y , du@@ m@@ b , stupid characters .
More recently , if you &apos;ve been following the Ken@@ y@@ an press — — these are the attribu@@ tes that they associated the Ken@@ y@@ an M@@ P@@ s with . But I want to challenge that .
I want to challenge that . Do you know why ?
Because M@@ P@@ s do not keep the environment clean . M@@ P@@ s do not help to prevent the spread of diseases .
They are har@@ dly mon@@ o@@ gam@@ ous . They are far from being extinc@@ t . And , my favorite is , vul@@ tures are better looking . So there &apos;s two types of vul@@ tures in this planet .
There are the New World vul@@ tures that are main@@ ly found in the Americ@@ as , like the con@@ d@@ ors and the car@@ ac@@ ar@@ as , and then the O@@ ld World vul@@ tures , where we have 16 species . From these 16 , 11 of them are facing a high risk of extinction .
So why are vul@@ tures important ? First of all , they provide v@@ ital eco@@ logical services . They clean up .
They &apos;re our natural gar@@ bage coll@@ ect@@ ors .
They clean up car@@ cas@@ ses right to the bone .
They help to kill all the bacteria . They help absor@@ b an@@ th@@ ra@@ x that would otherwise spread and cause huge liv@@ es@@ to@@ ck lo@@ sses and diseases in other animals .
R@@ ec@@ ent studies have shown that in areas where there are no vul@@ tures , car@@ cas@@ ses take up to three to four times to de@@ com@@ pose , and this has huge ram@@ i@@ fic@@ ations for the spread of diseases .
V@@ ul@@ tures also have tremendous histor@@ ical signific@@ ance .
They have been associated in ancient Egyp@@ tian culture .
Ne@@ k@@ h@@ bet was the symbo@@ l of the prot@@ ect@@ or and the mo@@ ther@@ hood , and together with the co@@ br@@ a , symbo@@ li@@ zed the un@@ ity between U@@ p@@ per and Lo@@ wer Egy@@ pt .
In H@@ in@@ du my@@ tho@@ logy , J@@ at@@ ay@@ u was the vul@@ ture go@@ d , and he ris@@ ked his life in order to save the go@@ dd@@ ess S@@ it@@ a from the 10@@ -@@ hea@@ ded dem@@ on R@@ av@@ ana .
In Ti@@ bet@@ an culture , they are perform@@ ing very important sky bu@@ ri@@ als . In places like Ti@@ bet , there are no places to bu@@ ry the dead , or wood to cre@@ mate them , so these vul@@ tures provide a natural dispos@@ al system .
So what is the problem with vul@@ tures ?
We have eight species of vul@@ tures that occu@@ r in Kenya , of which six are highly threat@@ en@@ ed with extinction .
The reason is that they &apos;re getting pois@@ oned , and the reason that they &apos;re getting pois@@ oned is because there &apos;s human@@ -@@ wil@@ d@@ life conflic@@ ts . The pas@@ tor@@ al communities are using this pois@@ on to target pre@@ dat@@ ors , and in return , the vul@@ tures are fall@@ ing victi@@ m to this .
In South Asia , in countries like India and Pakistan , four species of vul@@ tures are lis@@ ted as cri@@ tically end@@ anger@@ ed , which means they have less than 10 or 15 years to go extinc@@ t , and the reason is because they are fall@@ ing pre@@ y by consum@@ ing liv@@ es@@ to@@ ck that has been treated with a pain@@ killing drug like D@@ ic@@ lo@@ fen@@ ac .
This drug has now been b@@ ann@@ ed for v@@ eter@@ in@@ ary use in India , and they have taken a stand .
Because there are no vul@@ tures , there &apos;s been a spread in the numbers of fer@@ al dogs at car@@ cas@@ s du@@ mp sites , and when you have fer@@ al dogs , you have a huge time bom@@ b of rab@@ ies . The number of cases of rab@@ ies has increas@@ ed tremend@@ ously in India .
Kenya is going to have one of the largest wind far@@ ms in Africa : 3@@ 5@@ 3 wind turb@@ ines are going to be up at L@@ ake Tur@@ k@@ ana .
I am not against wind energy , but we need to work with the governments , because wind turb@@ ines do this to birds . They sli@@ ce them in half .
They are bir@@ d-@@ bl@@ ending machines .
In West Africa , there &apos;s a horri@@ fic trade of dead vul@@ tures to serve the wit@@ ch@@ craft and the fe@@ tish market .
So what &apos;s being done ? Well , we &apos;re conduc@@ ting research on these birds . We &apos;re putting trans@@ mit@@ ters on them .
We &apos;re trying to deter@@ mine their basic eco@@ logy , and see where they go .
We can see that they travel different countries , so if you focus on a problem loc@@ ally , it &apos;s not going to help you .
We need to work with governments in regi@@ onal levels .
We &apos;re working with local communities .
We &apos;re talking to them about appreci@@ ating vul@@ tures , about the need from within to appreci@@ ate these wonderful creatures and the services that they provide .
How can you help ? You can become active , make noise . You can write a letter to your government and tell them that we need to focus on these very mis@@ understood creatures . V@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ er your time to spread the word . S@@ pre@@ ad the word .
When you walk out of this room , you will be inform@@ ed about vul@@ tures , but speak to your families , to your children , to your neighb@@ ors about vul@@ tures .
They are very gr@@ ace@@ ful . Charles Darwin said he changed his mind because he watched them fly effor@@ t@@ less@@ ly without energy in the sk@@ ies .
Kenya , this world , will be much po@@ orer without these wonderful species .
Thank you very much .
Everything I do , and everything I do professi@@ on@@ ally -- my life -- has been shap@@ ed by seven years of work as a young man in Africa .
From 197@@ 1 to 197@@ 7 -- I look young , but I &apos;m not — -- I worked in Z@@ ambi@@ a , Kenya , I@@ v@@ ory Co@@ ast , Al@@ ger@@ ia , Som@@ ali@@ a , in projects of technical co@@ operation with African countries .
I worked for an Ital@@ ian N@@ G@@ O , and every single project that we set up in Africa failed .
And I was dis@@ trau@@ ght .
I thought , age 21 , that we Ital@@ i@@ ans were good people and we were doing good work in Africa .
Instead , everything we tou@@ ched we killed .
Our first project , the one that has inspired my first book , &quot; Ri@@ p@@ ples from the Z@@ am@@ be@@ z@@ i , &quot; was a project where we Ital@@ i@@ ans decided to teach Z@@ ambi@@ an people how to grow food .
So we arrived there with Ital@@ ian see@@ ds in sou@@ thern Z@@ ambi@@ a in this absolutely magni@@ fic@@ ent val@@ ley going down to the Z@@ am@@ be@@ z@@ i Ri@@ ver , and we taught the local people how to grow Ital@@ ian tom@@ ato@@ es and z@@ u@@ c@@ ch@@ in@@ i and ...
And of course the local people had absolutely no interest in doing that , so we paid them to come and work , and sometimes they would show up . And we were amaz@@ ed that the local people , in such a fer@@ tile val@@ ley , would not have any agriculture .
But instead of asking them how come they were not growing anything , we simply said , &quot; Thank God we &apos;re here . &quot; &quot; Just in the n@@ ick of time to save the Z@@ ambi@@ an people from star@@ vation . &quot;
And of course , everything in Africa grew beauti@@ fully .
We had these magni@@ fic@@ ent tom@@ ato@@ es . In Ital@@ y , a tom@@ a@@ to would grow to this size . In Z@@ ambi@@ a , to this size .
And we could not believe , and we were telling the Z@@ ambi@@ ans , &quot; Look how easy agriculture is . &quot;
When the tom@@ ato@@ es were nice and ri@@ pe and red , over@@ night , some 200 hi@@ p@@ pos came out from the river and they ate everything . And we said to the Z@@ ambi@@ ans , &quot; My God , the hi@@ p@@ pos ! &quot;
And the Z@@ ambi@@ ans said , &quot; Yes , that &apos;s why we have no agriculture here . &quot; &quot; Why didn &apos;t you tell us ? &quot; &quot; You never asked . &quot;
I thought it was only us Ital@@ i@@ ans bl@@ under@@ ing around Africa , but then I saw what the Americans were doing , what the English were doing , what the French were doing , and after seeing what they were doing , I became quite proud of our project in Z@@ ambi@@ a .
Because , you see , at least we f@@ ed the hi@@ p@@ pos .
You should see the ru@@ b@@ b@@ ish — -- You should see the ru@@ b@@ b@@ ish that we have bes@@ to@@ wed on un@@ su@@ spec@@ ting African people .
You want to read the book , read &quot; D@@ ead A@@ id , &quot; by D@@ amb@@ is@@ a M@@ oy@@ o , Z@@ ambi@@ an woman econom@@ ist .
The book was published in 2009 .
We Western don@@ or countries have given the African continent two trillion American dollars in the last 50 years .
I &apos;m not going to tell you the damage that that money has done .
Just go and read her book .
R@@ ead it from an African woman , the damage that we have done .
We Western people are im@@ peri@@ alis@@ t , colon@@ i@@ alis@@ t mis@@ sion@@ aries , and there are only two ways we deal with people : We either p@@ a@@ tron@@ ize them , or we are pat@@ ern@@ alis@@ tic .
The two words come from the L@@ atin ro@@ ot &quot; p@@ ater , &quot; which means &quot; father . &quot;
But they mean two different things .
P@@ at@@ ern@@ alis@@ tic , I treat anybody from a different culture as if they were my children . &quot; I love you so much . &quot;
P@@ a@@ tron@@ izing , I treat everybody from another culture as if they were my serv@@ ants .
That &apos;s why the white people in Africa are called &quot; b@@ wan@@ a , &quot; bo@@ ss .
I was given a s@@ la@@ p in the face reading a book , &quot; Sm@@ all is Beau@@ ti@@ ful , &quot; written by S@@ chu@@ ma@@ cher , who said , above all in economic development , if people do not wish to be helped , leave them alone .
This should be the first principle of aid .
The first principle of aid is respect .
This morning , the gentlem@@ an who opened this conference lay a stick on the floor , and said , &quot; Can we -- can you imagine a city that is not ne@@ oc@@ ol@@ on@@ ial ? &quot;
I decided when I was 27 years old to only respond to people , and I invented a system called En@@ ter@@ prise F@@ ac@@ il@@ itation , where you never initi@@ ate anything , you never motiv@@ ate anybody , but you become a serv@@ ant of the local passion , the serv@@ ant of local people who have a dream to become a better person .
So what you do -- you sh@@ ut up .
You never arrive in a community with any ideas , and you sit with the local people .
We don &apos;t work from off@@ ices .
We meet at the caf@@ e . We meet at the pu@@ b .
We have zero infrastructure .
And what we do , we become friends , and we find out what that person wants to do .
The most important thing is passion .
You can give somebody an idea .
If that person doesn &apos;t want to do it , what are you going to do ?
The passion that the person has for her own growth is the most important thing .
The passion that that man has for his own personal growth is the most important thing .
And then we help them to go and find the knowledge , because nobody in the world can succe@@ ed alone .
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge , but the knowledge is available .
So years and years ago , I had this idea : Why don &apos;t we , for once , instead of arri@@ ving in the community to tell people what to do , why don &apos;t , for once , listen to them ? But not in community me@@ et@@ ings .
Let me tell you a secret .
There is a problem with community me@@ et@@ ings .
En@@ tre@@ pren@@ eurs never come , and they never tell you , in a public meeting , what they want to do with their own money , what opportunity they have identi@@ fied .
So planning has this blind spot .
The smar@@ test people in your community you don &apos;t even know , because they don &apos;t come to your public me@@ et@@ ings .
What we do , we work one-@@ on-@@ one , and to work one-@@ on-@@ one , you have to create a social infrastructure that doesn &apos;t exist .
You have to create a new prof@@ ession .
The prof@@ ession is the family doctor of enter@@ prise , the family doctor of business , who s@@ its with you in your house , at your kitch@@ en table , at the caf@@ e , and helps you find the resources to transform your passion into a way to make a living .
I started this as a tr@@ y@@ out in E@@ sper@@ ance , in Western Australia .
I was a doing a Ph@@ .@@ D@@ . at the time , trying to go away from this p@@ a@@ tron@@ izing bul@@ l@@ sh@@ it that we arrive and tell you what to do .
And so what I did in E@@ sper@@ ance that first year was to just walk the streets , and in three days I had my first client , and I helped this first guy who was smo@@ king fish from a gar@@ age , was a Ma@@ or@@ i guy , and I helped him to sell to the restaurant in Per@@ th , to get organized , and then the fish@@ er@@ men came to me to say , &quot; You the guy who helped Ma@@ or@@ i ? Can you help us ? &quot;
And I helped these five fish@@ er@@ men to work together and get this beautiful tun@@ a not to the c@@ ann@@ ery in Al@@ b@@ any for 60 cents a kil@@ o , but we found a way to take the fish for su@@ sh@@ i to Japan for 15 dollars a kil@@ o , and the farmers came to talk to me , said , &quot; Hey , you helped them . Can you help us ? &quot;
In a year , I had 27 projects going on , and the government came to see me to say , &quot; How can you do that ?
How can you do — ? &quot; And I said , &quot; I do something very , very , very difficult .
I sh@@ ut up , and listen to them . &quot; So — — So the government says , &quot; Do it again . &quot; We &apos;ve done it in 300 communities around the world .
We have helped to start 4@@ 0,000 businesses .
There is a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of sol@@ itude .
Peter D@@ ru@@ ck@@ er , one of the greatest management consul@@ t@@ ants in history , died age 9@@ 6 , a few years ago .
Peter D@@ ru@@ ck@@ er was a professor of philosoph@@ y before becoming involved in business , and this is what Peter D@@ ru@@ ck@@ er says : &quot; Pl@@ ann@@ ing is actually in@@ compati@@ ble with an entrepren@@ eu@@ ri@@ al society and economy . &quot;
Pl@@ ann@@ ing is the k@@ is@@ s of death of entrepren@@ eur@@ ship .
So now you &apos;re re@@ building Christ@@ chur@@ ch without knowing what the smar@@ test people in Christ@@ chur@@ ch want to do with their own money and their own energy .
You have to learn how to get these people to come and talk to you .
You have to offer them confi@@ denti@@ ality , priv@@ acy , you have to be fantastic at helping them , and then they will come , and they will come in dro@@ ves .
In a community of 10,000 people , we get 200 clients .
Can you imagine a community of 4@@ 00,000 people , the intelligence and the passion ?
Which pres@@ entation have you appl@@ au@@ ded the most this morning ?
L@@ oc@@ al , passionate people . That &apos;s who you have appl@@ au@@ ded .
So what I &apos;m saying is that entrepren@@ eur@@ ship is where it &apos;s at .
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- non@@ ren@@ ew@@ able fossi@@ l fu@@ els , manufactu@@ ring -- and all of a sudden , we have systems which are not sustainable .
The intern@@ al combus@@ tion engine is not sustainable .
Fre@@ on way of ma@@ int@@ aining things is not sustainable .
What we have to look at is at how we feed , cure , educ@@ ate , transport , communicate for seven billion people in a sustainable way .
The technologies do not exist to do that .
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution ? Uni@@ ver@@ si@@ ties ? For@@ get about it !
Go@@ vern@@ ment ? For@@ get about it !
It will be entrepreneurs , and they &apos;re doing it now .
There &apos;s a lo@@ vely story that I read in a fu@@ tur@@ ist magazine many , many years ago .
There was a group of experts who were invited to discus@@ s the future of the city of New York in 18@@ 60 .
And in 18@@ 60 , this group of people came together , and they all spec@@ ul@@ ated about what would happen to the city of New York in 100 years , and the conclusion was un@@ anim@@ ous : The city of New York would not exist in 100 years .
Why ? Because they looked at the cur@@ ve and said , if the population kee@@ ps growing at this rate , to move the population of New York around , they would have needed six million hor@@ ses , and the man@@ ure created by six million hor@@ ses would be impossible to deal with .
They were already dro@@ w@@ ning in man@@ ure . So 18@@ 60 , they are seeing this dir@@ ty technology that is going to cho@@ ke the life out of New York .
So what happens ? In 40 years &apos; time , in the year 19@@ 00 , in the United States of America , there were 1,@@ 00@@ 1 car manufactu@@ ring companies -- 1,@@ 00@@ 1 .
The idea of finding a different technology had absolutely taken over , and there were tiny , tiny little fact@@ ories in back@@ wat@@ ers .
D@@ ear@@ born , Mich@@ ig@@ an . Hen@@ ry For@@ d .
However , there is a secret to work with entrepreneurs .
First , you have to offer them confi@@ denti@@ ality .
O@@ ther@@ wise they don &apos;t come and talk to you .
Then you have to offer them absolute , de@@ dic@@ ated , passionate service to them .
And then you have to tell them the truth about entrepren@@ eur@@ ship .
The small@@ est company , the biggest company , has to be capable of doing three things beauti@@ fully : The product that you want to sell has to be fantastic , you have to have fantastic marketing , and you have to have tremendous financial management .
Gu@@ ess what ?
We have never met a single human being in the world who can make it , sell it and look after the money .
It doesn &apos;t exist .
This person has never been born .
We &apos;ve done the research , and we have looked at the 100 i@@ con@@ ic companies of the world -- Car@@ ne@@ gie , W@@ est@@ in@@ gh@@ ou@@ se , E@@ dis@@ on , For@@ d , all the new companies , Google , Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o .
There &apos;s only one thing that all the successful companies in the world have in common , only one : N@@ one were started by one person .
Now we teach entrepren@@ eur@@ ship to 16@@ -@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds in Nor@@ th@@ um@@ ber@@ land , and we start the class by giving them the first two pages of Richard B@@ ran@@ son &apos;s auto@@ bio@@ graph@@ y , and the task of the 16@@ -@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds is to under@@ line , in the first two pages of Richard B@@ ran@@ son &apos;s auto@@ bio@@ graph@@ y how many times Richard uses the word &quot; I &quot; and how many times he uses the word &quot; we . &quot;
N@@ ever the word &quot; I , &quot; and the word &quot; we &quot; 32 times .
He wasn &apos;t alone when he started .
No@@ body started a company alone . No one .
So we can create the community where we have facil@@ it@@ ators who come from a small business background sitting in caf@@ es , in b@@ ars , and your de@@ dic@@ ated bud@@ dies who will do to you , what somebody did for this gentlem@@ an who talks about this epi@@ c , somebody who will say to you , &quot; What do you need ?
What can you do ? Can you make it ?
Okay , can you sell it ? Can you look after the money ? &quot;
&quot; Oh , no , I cannot do this . &quot; &quot; Would you like me to find you somebody ? &quot;
We activ@@ ate communities .
We have groups of volunte@@ ers sup@@ porting the En@@ ter@@ prise F@@ ac@@ il@@ it@@ ator to help you to find resources and people and we have discovered that the miracle of the intelligence of local people is such that you can change the culture and the economy of this community just by captur@@ ing the passion , the energy and imagination of your own people .
Thank you .
There are a lot of ways the people around us can help improve our lives .
We don &apos;t bu@@ mp into every neighb@@ or , so a lot of wisdom never gets passed on , though we do share the same public spaces .
So over the past few years , I &apos;ve tried ways to share more with my neighb@@ ors in public space , using simple tools like stic@@ kers , st@@ enc@@ ils and ch@@ alk .
And these projects came from questions I had , like : How much are my neighb@@ ors paying for their ap@@ art@@ ments ?
How can we l@@ end and bor@@ row more things , without kno@@ c@@ king on each other &apos;s do@@ ors at a bad time ?
How can we share more mem@@ ories of our aband@@ oned buildings , and gain a better understanding of our landscape ?
How can we share more of our hop@@ es for our vac@@ ant sto@@ re@@ fron@@ ts , so our communities can refl@@ ect our needs and dreams today ?
Now , I live in New Or@@ le@@ ans , and I am in love with New Or@@ le@@ ans .
My sou@@ l is always so@@ o@@ th@@ ed by the giant live o@@ ak trees , sh@@ ad@@ ing lo@@ vers , dr@@ un@@ ks and dre@@ am@@ ers for hundreds of years , and I trust a city that always makes way for music .
I feel like every time someone s@@ nee@@ zes , New Or@@ le@@ ans has a par@@ ade . The city has some of the most beautiful architecture in the world , but it also has one of the highest amoun@@ ts of aband@@ oned properties in America .
I live near this house , and I thought about how I could make it a nic@@ er space for my neighborhood , and I also thought about something that changed my life forever .
In 2009 , I lost someone I loved very much .
Her name was Jo@@ an , and she was a mother to me .
And her death was sudden and un@@ expected .
And I thought about death a lot .
And ... this made me feel deep grati@@ tude for the time I &apos;ve had .
And ... brought cl@@ ar@@ ity to the things that are meaning@@ ful to my life now .
But I struggle to ma@@ intain this perspective in my daily life .
I feel like it &apos;s easy to get caught up in the d@@ ay@@ -@@ to-@@ day , and forget what really matters to you .
So with help from old and new friends , I turned the side of this aband@@ oned house into a giant chal@@ k@@ board , and st@@ enc@@ il@@ ed it with a f@@ ill@@ -@@ in-@@ the@@ -@@ bl@@ ank sentence : &quot; Be@@ fore I die , I want to ... &quot;
So anyone walking by can pick up a piece of ch@@ alk , refl@@ ect on their life , and share their personal aspir@@ ations in public space .
I didn &apos;t know what to expect from this experiment , but by the next day , the wall was entirely filled out , and it kept growing .
And I &apos;d like to share a few things that people wrote on this wall .
&quot; Be@@ fore I die , I want to be tried for pi@@ rac@@ y . &quot; &quot; Be@@ fore I die , I want to str@@ add@@ le the International D@@ at@@ el@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; Be@@ fore I die , I want to sing for millions . &quot;
&quot; Be@@ fore I die , I want to plant a tree . &quot;
&quot; Be@@ fore I die , I want to live off the gri@@ d . &quot;
&quot; Be@@ fore I die , I want to hold her one more time . &quot;
&quot; Be@@ fore I die , I want to be someone &apos;s c@@ av@@ al@@ ry . &quot;
&quot; Be@@ fore I die , I want to be completely myself . &quot;
So this ne@@ gl@@ ected space became a construc@@ tive one , and people &apos;s hop@@ es and dreams made me l@@ augh out l@@ oud , t@@ ear up , and they con@@ sol@@ ed me during my own tough times .
It &apos;s about knowing you &apos;re not alone ; it &apos;s about understanding our neighb@@ ors in new and en@@ li@@ ghten@@ ing ways ; it &apos;s about making space for refl@@ ection and cont@@ empl@@ ation , and rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ing what really matters most to us as we grow and change .
I made this last year , and started rece@@ iv@@ ing hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to make a wall with their community .
So , my civi@@ c center colleagues and I made a tool k@@ it , and now walls have been made in countries around the world , including K@@ az@@ ak@@ h@@ st@@ an , South Africa , Australia , Ar@@ gent@@ ina , and beyond .
To@@ gether , we &apos;ve shown how powerful our public spaces can be if we &apos;re given the opportunity to have a voice , and share more with one another .
Two of the most valuable things we have are time , and our relationships with other people .
In our age of increasing distr@@ actions , it &apos;s more important than ever to find ways to ma@@ intain perspective , and remember that life is bri@@ ef and tend@@ er .
De@@ ath is something that we &apos;re often dis@@ cour@@ aged to talk about , or even think about , but I &apos;ve realized that prepar@@ ing for death is one of the most em@@ power@@ ing things you can do .
Th@@ inking about death cl@@ ari@@ fi@@ es your life .
Our shared spaces can better refl@@ ect what matters to us , as individuals and as a community , and with more ways to share our hop@@ es , f@@ ears and stories , the people around us can not only help us make better places , they can help us lead better lives .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Today I have just one requ@@ est .
Please don &apos;t tell me I &apos;m normal .
Now I &apos;d like to introduce you to my bro@@ thers .
Rem@@ i is 22 , t@@ all and very hand@@ some .
He &apos;s spe@@ ech@@ less , but he communic@@ ates joy in a way that some of the best or@@ ators cannot .
Rem@@ i knows what love is .
He shares it un@@ condi@@ tion@@ ally and he shares it regard@@ less .
He &apos;s not gre@@ e@@ dy . He doesn &apos;t see skin color .
He doesn &apos;t care about religious differences , and get this : He has never told a lie .
When he s@@ ings son@@ gs from our childhood , attemp@@ ting words that not even I could remember , he re@@ minds me of one thing : how little we know about the mind , and how wonderful the un@@ known must be .
Sam@@ u@@ el is 16 . He &apos;s t@@ all . He &apos;s very hand@@ some .
He has the most imp@@ ec@@ c@@ able memory .
He has a sel@@ ective one , though .
He doesn &apos;t remember if he st@@ ole my chocol@@ ate bar , but he rem@@ em@@ bers the year of release for every song on my iP@@ od , conversations we had when he was four , wee@@ ing on my arm on the first ever ep@@ is@@ ode of T@@ el@@ et@@ u@@ b@@ bi@@ es , and Lad@@ y G@@ ag@@ a &apos;s bir@@ th@@ day .
Don &apos;t they sound incredible ?
But most people don &apos;t agree .
And in fact , because their minds don &apos;t fit into society &apos;s version of normal , they &apos;re often by@@ passed and mis@@ understood .
But what lif@@ ted my heart and str@@ eng@@ th@@ en@@ ed my sou@@ l was that even though this was the case , although they were not seen as ordinary , this could only mean one thing : that they were extraordinary -- au@@ ti@@ stic and extraordinary .
Now , for you who may be less familiar with the term &quot; autism , &quot; it &apos;s a complex brain dis@@ order that aff@@ ects social communication , learning and sometimes physical skills .
It manif@@ ests in each individual differently , h@@ ence why Rem@@ i is so different from S@@ am .
And across the world , every 20 minutes , one new person is diagno@@ sed with autism , and although it &apos;s one of the fas@@ t@@ est-@@ growing develop@@ mental dis@@ orders in the world , there is no known cause or cure .
And I cannot remember the first moment I en@@ coun@@ tered autism , but I cannot rec@@ all a day without it .
I was just three years old when my brother came along , and I was so excited that I had a new being in my life .
And after a few months went by , I realized that he was different .
He scre@@ amed a lot .
He didn &apos;t want to play like the other babies did , and in fact , he didn &apos;t seem very interested in me what@@ so@@ ever .
Rem@@ i lived and re@@ ign@@ ed in his own world , with his own rules , and he found plea@@ sure in the small@@ est things , like lin@@ ing up cars around the room and star@@ ing at the wash@@ ing machine and eating anything that came in between .
And as he grew older , he grew more different , and the differences became more obvious .
Yet beyond the tan@@ tru@@ ms and the frustr@@ ation and the n@@ ever@@ -@@ ending hyper@@ activity was something really unique : a pure and inno@@ cent nature , a boy who saw the world without pre@@ ju@@ di@@ ce , a human who had never li@@ ed .
Ex@@ tra@@ ordinary .
Now , I cannot den@@ y that there have been some challeng@@ ing moments in my family , moments where I &apos;ve w@@ ished that they were just like me .
But I c@@ ast my mind back to the things that they &apos;ve taught me about individu@@ ality and communication and love , and I realize that these are things that I wouldn &apos;t want to change with nor@@ mal@@ ity .
Nor@@ mal@@ ity over@@ looks the beauty that differences give us , and the fact that we are different doesn &apos;t mean that one of us is wrong .
It just means that there &apos;s a different kind of right .
And if I could communicate just one thing to Rem@@ i and to S@@ am and to you , it would be that you don &apos;t have to be normal .
You can be extraordinary .
Because au@@ ti@@ stic or not , the differences that we have -- We &apos;ve got a gi@@ ft ! Every@@ one &apos;s got a gi@@ ft inside of us , and in all hon@@ es@@ ty , the pur@@ suit of nor@@ mal@@ ity is the ul@@ timate sacri@@ fice of potential .
The chance for great@@ ness , for progress and for change dies the moment we try to be like someone else .
Please -- don &apos;t tell me I &apos;m normal .
Thank you .
F@@ ive years ago , I experienced a bit of what it must have been like to be A@@ lice in W@@ on@@ der@@ land .
Pen@@ n State asked me , a communications teacher , to teach a communications class for engineering students .
And I was scar@@ ed . Re@@ ally scar@@ ed . S@@ car@@ ed of these students with their big brains and their big books and their big , un@@ familiar words .
But as these conversations un@@ fol@@ ded , I experienced what A@@ lice must have when she went down that rab@@ bit hole and saw that door to a whole new world .
That &apos;s just how I felt as I had those conversations with the students . I was amaz@@ ed at the ideas that they had , and I wanted others to experience this wonder@@ land as well .
And I believe the key to opening that door is great communication .
We des@@ per@@ ately need great communication from our scientists and engineers in order to change the world .
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are t@@ ack@@ ling our grand@@ est challenges , from energy to environment to health care , among others , and if we don &apos;t know about it and understand it , then the work isn &apos;t done , and I believe it &apos;s our responsibility as non-@@ scientists to have these interactions .
But these great conversations can &apos;t occu@@ r if our scientists and engineers don &apos;t invite us in to see their wonder@@ land .
So scientists and engineers , please , talk ner@@ dy to us .
I want to share a few keys on how you can do that to make sure that we can see that your science is sex@@ y and that your engineering is engag@@ ing .
First question to answer for us : so what ?
T@@ ell us why your science is relevant to us .
Don &apos;t just tell me that you study tr@@ ab@@ ec@@ ul@@ ae , but tell me that you study tr@@ ab@@ ec@@ ul@@ ae , which is the mes@@ h@@ -@@ like structure of our b@@ ones because it &apos;s important to understanding and tre@@ ating o@@ ste@@ o@@ po@@ ro@@ sis .
And when you &apos;re descri@@ bing your science , be@@ ware of j@@ arg@@ on .
J@@ arg@@ on is a barri@@ er to our understanding of your ideas .
Su@@ re , you can say &quot; spatial and tempor@@ al , &quot; but why not just say &quot; space and time , &quot; which is so much more accessible to us ?
And making your ideas accessible is not the same as du@@ m@@ bing it down .
Instead , as Einstein said , make everything as simple as possible , but no simpl@@ er .
You can clearly communicate your science without com@@ prom@@ is@@ ing the ideas .
A few things to consider are having examples , stories and analo@@ gies . Those are ways to engage and exc@@ ite us about your content .
And when pres@@ enting your work , drop the bul@@ let points .
Have you ever wonder@@ ed why they &apos;re called bul@@ let points ? What do bul@@ lets do ? B@@ ul@@ lets kill , and they will kill your pres@@ entation .
A slide like this is not only bor@@ ing , but it reli@@ es too much on the language area of our brain , and causes us to become over@@ wh@@ el@@ med .
Instead , this example slide by Gen@@ ev@@ i@@ eve Bro@@ wn is much more effective . It &apos;s showing that the special structure of tr@@ ab@@ ec@@ ul@@ ae are so strong that they actually inspired the unique design of the E@@ i@@ ff@@ el To@@ wer .
And the trick here is to use a single , read@@ able sentence that the audience can key into if they get a bit lost , and then provide visu@@ als which appe@@ al to our other sen@@ ses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what &apos;s being described .
So I think these are just a few keys that can help the rest of us to open that door and see the wonder@@ land that is science and engineering .
And because the engineers that I &apos;ve worked with have taught me to become really in touch with my inner ner@@ d , I want to sum@@ mar@@ ize with an equ@@ ation . Take your science , sub@@ tr@@ act your bul@@ let points and your j@@ arg@@ on , di@@ vide by relev@@ ance , meaning share what &apos;s relevant to the audience , and multi@@ ply it by the passion that you have for this incredible work that you &apos;re doing , and that is going to equal incredible interactions
that are full of understanding .
And so , scientists and engineers , when you &apos;ve solved this equ@@ ation , by all means , talk ner@@ dy to me . Thank you .
One of my favorite words in the whole of the Oxford English D@@ ic@@ tionary is &quot; s@@ no@@ l@@ ly@@ go@@ ster . &quot;
Just because it sounds so good .
And what s@@ no@@ l@@ ly@@ go@@ ster means is &quot; a dis@@ honest politici@@ an . &quot;
Al@@ though there was a 19@@ th-@@ century newsp@@ aper ed@@ it@@ or who defined it rather better when he said , &quot; A s@@ no@@ l@@ ly@@ go@@ ster is a fellow who see@@ ks office regard@@ less of party , platform or principle , and who , when he w@@ ins , gets there by the she@@ er force of mon@@ u@@ mental tal@@ kno@@ ph@@ ical as@@ sum@@ n@@ ancy . &quot;
Now I have no idea what &quot; tal@@ kno@@ ph@@ ical &quot; is .
Some@@ thing to do with words , I assu@@ me .
But it &apos;s very important that words are at the center of politics , and all politicians know they have to try and control language .
It wasn &apos;t until , for example , 17@@ 7@@ 1 that the British Par@@ li@@ ament allowed newsp@@ ap@@ ers to report the exact words that were said in the deb@@ ating cham@@ ber .
And this was actually all down to the br@@ av@@ ery of a guy with the extraordinary name of Br@@ ass Cro@@ s@@ by , who took on Par@@ li@@ ament .
And he was thro@@ wn into the To@@ wer of London and im@@ pris@@ oned , but he was br@@ ave enough , he was br@@ ave enough to take them on , and in the end he had such popular support in London that he won .
And it was only a few years later that we have the first recor@@ ded use of the phrase &quot; as b@@ old as br@@ ass . &quot;
Most people think that &apos;s down to the met@@ al .
It &apos;s not . It &apos;s down to a campaig@@ ner for the freedom of the press .
But to really show you how words and politics interact , I want to take you back to the United States of America , just after they &apos;d achiev@@ ed in@@ depend@@ ence .
And they had to face the question of what to call George Washington , their leader .
They didn &apos;t know .
What do you call the leader of a re@@ publi@@ can country ?
And this was deb@@ ated in Congr@@ ess for ages and ages .
And there were all sorts of sugges@@ tions on the table , which might have made it .
I mean , some people wanted him to be called Chi@@ ef Mag@@ istr@@ ate Washington , and other people , His H@@ igh@@ ness George Washington , and other people , Pr@@ ot@@ ect@@ or of the Li@@ ber@@ ties of the People of the United States of America Washington .
Not that cat@@ ch@@ y .
Some people just wanted to call him King .
They thought it was tried and tes@@ ted .
And they weren &apos;t even being mon@@ arch@@ ical there , they had the idea that you could be elec@@ ted King for a fix@@ ed term .
And , you know , it could have worked .
And everybody got in@@ san@@ ely bo@@ red , actually , because this debate went on for three weeks .
I read a di@@ ary of this poor sen@@ ator , who just kee@@ ps coming back , &quot; S@@ till on this subject . &quot;
And the reason for the del@@ ay and the bo@@ re@@ dom was that the Hou@@ se of Re@@ pres@@ ent@@ atives were against the S@@ en@@ ate .
The Hou@@ se of Re@@ pres@@ ent@@ atives didn &apos;t want Washington to get dr@@ un@@ k on power .
They didn &apos;t want to call him King in case that gave him ideas , or his success@@ or ideas .
So they wanted to give him the hum@@ bl@@ est , me@@ ag@@ er@@ est , most p@@ a@@ thetic ti@@ tle that they could think of .
And that ti@@ tle was &quot; President . &quot;
President . They didn &apos;t invent the ti@@ tle . I mean , it exis@@ ted before , but it just meant somebody who pres@@ ides over a meeting .
It was like the fore@@ man of the j@@ ury .
And it didn &apos;t have much more grand@@ eur than the term &quot; fore@@ man &quot; or &quot; over@@ se@@ er . &quot;
There were occas@@ i@@ onal pres@@ id@@ ents of little colon@@ ial coun@@ c@@ ils and bits of government , but it was really a nothing ti@@ tle .
And that &apos;s why the S@@ en@@ ate obj@@ ected to it .
They said , that &apos;s ridi@@ cul@@ ous , you can &apos;t call him President .
This guy has to go and sign tre@@ ati@@ es and meet foreign dign@@ it@@ aries .
And who &apos;s going to take him seriously if he &apos;s got a sil@@ ly little ti@@ tle like President of the United States of America ?
And after three weeks of debate , in the end the S@@ en@@ ate did not cave in .
Instead , they agre@@ ed to use the ti@@ tle &quot; President &quot; for now , but they also wanted it absolutely set down that they didn &apos;t agree with it from a dec@@ ent respect for the opin@@ ions and practice of civi@@ li@@ zed nations , whether under re@@ publi@@ can or mon@@ arch@@ ical forms of government , whose cu@@ st@@ om it is to an@@ ne@@ x , through the office of the Chi@@ ef Mag@@ istr@@ ate , titles of resp@@ ect@@ ability --
not bloo@@ dy President -- and that in the inter@@ course with foreign nations , the maj@@ es@@ ty of the people of the United States may not be h@@ az@@ ar@@ ded by an appear@@ ance of sing@@ ul@@ ar@@ ity , i@@ .@@ e@@ . , we don &apos;t want to look like bloo@@ dy we@@ ir@@ dos .
Now you can learn three interesting things from this .
First of all -- and this is my favorite -- is that so far as I &apos;ve ever been able to find out , the S@@ en@@ ate has never form@@ ally end@@ ors@@ ed the ti@@ tle of President .
Bar@@ ack Obama , President Obama , is there on bor@@ ro@@ wed time , just waiting for the S@@ en@@ ate to spring into action .
Second thing you can learn is that when a government says that this is a tempor@@ ary measure -- -- you can still be waiting 2@@ 23 years later .
But the third thing you can learn , and this is the really important one , this is the point I want to leave you on , is that the ti@@ tle , President of the United States of America , doesn &apos;t sound that hum@@ ble at all these days , does it ?
Some@@ thing to do with the slightly over 5,000 nuclear war@@ heads he has at his dispos@@ al and the largest economy in the world and a fle@@ et of drones and all that sort of stuff .
Re@@ ality and history have end@@ ow@@ ed that ti@@ tle with grand@@ eur .
And so the S@@ en@@ ate won in the end .
They got their ti@@ tle of resp@@ ect@@ ability .
And also , the S@@ en@@ ate &apos;s other worry , the appear@@ ance of sing@@ ul@@ ar@@ ity -- well , it was a sing@@ ul@@ ar@@ ity back then .
But now , do you know how many nations have a president ?
A hundred and for@@ ty@@ -@@ seven .
All because they want to sound like the guy who &apos;s got the 5,000 nuclear war@@ heads , etc .
And so , in the end , the S@@ en@@ ate won and the Hou@@ se of Re@@ pres@@ ent@@ atives lost , because nobody &apos;s going to feel that hum@@ ble when they &apos;re told that they are now the President of the United States of America .
And that &apos;s the important lesson I think you can take away , and the one I want to leave you with .
Po@@ li@@ tici@@ ans try to pick words and use words to shape reality and control reality , but in fact , reality changes words far more than words can ever change reality .
Thank you very much .
I &apos;m 150 feet down an il@@ legal mine sh@@ aft in Ghana .
The air is th@@ ick with heat and d@@ ust , and it &apos;s hard to brea@@ the .
I can feel the br@@ ush of swe@@ at@@ y bodies pass@@ ing me in the dark@@ ness , but I can &apos;t see much else .
I hear voices talking , but mostly the sh@@ aft is this c@@ ac@@ op@@ hon@@ y of men cou@@ gh@@ ing , and stone being broken with prim@@ itive tools .
Like the others , I wear a f@@ lic@@ k@@ ering , cheap fl@@ ash@@ light ti@@ ed to my head with this el@@ as@@ tic , tat@@ tered band , and I can bar@@ ely make out the s@@ lic@@ k tree lim@@ bs holding up the walls of the three-@@ foot square hole dro@@ pping hundreds of feet into the earth .
When my hand sli@@ ps , I suddenly remember a min@@ er I had met days before who had lost his gri@@ p and fell coun@@ t@@ less feet down that sh@@ aft .
As I stand talking to you today , these men are still deep in that hole , ris@@ king their lives without pay@@ ment or com@@ pens@@ ation , and often dying .
I got to clim@@ b out of that hole , and I got to go home , but they likely never will , because they &apos;re tr@@ apped in sl@@ av@@ ery .
For the last 28 years , I &apos;ve been document@@ ing indi@@ gen@@ ous cultures in more than 70 countries on six contin@@ ents , and in 2009 I had the great hon@@ or of being the so@@ le exhi@@ bit@@ or at the V@@ an@@ cou@@ ver P@@ ea@@ ce Su@@ m@@ mit .
A@@ mon@@ g@@ st all the as@@ ton@@ ishing people I met there , I met a sup@@ porter of F@@ ree the S@@ l@@ aves , an N@@ G@@ O de@@ dic@@ ated to er@@ a@@ dic@@ ating modern day sl@@ av@@ ery .
We started talking about sl@@ av@@ ery , and really , I started learning about sl@@ av@@ ery , for I had certainly known it exis@@ ted in the world , but not to such a degree .
After we finished talking , I felt so horrible and hon@@ est@@ ly ash@@ amed at my own lack of knowledge of this a@@ tro@@ city in my own lifetime , and I thought , if I don &apos;t know , how many other people don &apos;t know ?
It started bur@@ ning a hole in my stom@@ ach , so within weeks , I fle@@ w down to Los Angeles to meet with the direc@@ tor of F@@ ree the S@@ l@@ aves and offer them my help .
Th@@ us began my journey into modern day sl@@ av@@ ery .
O@@ dd@@ ly , I had been to many of these places before .
Some I even considered like my second home .
But this time , I would see the sk@@ el@@ et@@ ons hidden in the clo@@ set .
A conserv@@ ative estim@@ ate tells us there are more than 27 million people en@@ sl@@ av@@ ed in the world today .
That &apos;s double the amount of people taken from Africa during the entire trans@@ -@@ Atlan@@ tic sl@@ ave trade .
A hundred and fi@@ f@@ ty years ago , an agri@@ cultural sl@@ ave cost about three times the annu@@ al sal@@ ary of an American wor@@ ker .
That equ@@ ates to about $ 5@@ 0,000 in today &apos;s money .
Yet today , entire families can be en@@ sl@@ av@@ ed for generations over a deb@@ t as small as $ 18 .
A@@ st@@ on@@ ish@@ ingly , sl@@ av@@ ery gener@@ ates profits of more than $ 13 billion worldwide each year .
Many have been tric@@ ked by fal@@ se prom@@ ises of a good education , a better job , only to find that they &apos;re forced to work without pay under the threat of violence , and they cannot walk away .
Today &apos;s sl@@ av@@ ery is about commerce , so the go@@ ods that en@@ sl@@ av@@ ed people produce have value , but the people producing them are dispos@@ able .
S@@ lav@@ ery exists everywhere , nearly , in the world , and yet it is il@@ legal everywhere in the world .
In India and Ne@@ p@@ al , I was introduced to the bri@@ ck kil@@ ns .
This strange and awesome sight was like walking into ancient Egy@@ pt or D@@ ante &apos;s In@@ fer@@ no .
En@@ v@@ elop@@ ed in temper@@ atures of 1@@ 30 degrees , men , women , children , entire families in fact , were clo@@ a@@ ked in a heavy blan@@ ket of d@@ ust , while mechan@@ ically stac@@ king bri@@ cks on their head , up to 18 at a time , and carrying them from the s@@ cor@@ ching kil@@ ns to truc@@ ks hundreds of y@@ ards away .
D@@ ea@@ den@@ ed by mon@@ ot@@ ony and ex@@ h@@ aus@@ tion , they work sil@@ ently , doing this task over and over for 16 or 17 hours a day .
There were no brea@@ ks for food , no water brea@@ ks , and the sev@@ ere de@@ hy@@ dr@@ ation made ur@@ in@@ ating pretty much in@@ conse@@ qu@@ enti@@ al .
So per@@ vas@@ ive was the heat and the d@@ ust that my camera became too hot to even touch and ce@@ ased working .
Every 20 minutes , I &apos;d have to run back to our cru@@ iser to clean out my g@@ ear and run it under an air condi@@ tion@@ er to re@@ vi@@ ve it , and as I sat there , I thought , my camera is getting far better treatment than these people .
B@@ ack in the kil@@ ns , I wanted to cr@@ y , but the abo@@ li@@ tion@@ ist next to me quickly gr@@ ab@@ bed me and he said , &quot; L@@ is@@ a , don &apos;t do that . Just don &apos;t do that here . &quot;
And he very clearly expl@@ ained to me that emotional dis@@ plays are very dangerous in a place like this , not just for me , but for them .
I couldn &apos;t offer them any direct help .
I couldn &apos;t give them money , nothing .
I wasn &apos;t a citiz@@ en of that country .
I could get them in a worse situation than they were already in .
I &apos;d have to rely on F@@ ree the S@@ l@@ aves to work within the system for their liber@@ ation , and I tru@@ st@@ ed that they would .
As for me , I &apos;d have to wait until I got home to really feel my hear@@ t@@ break .
In the H@@ im@@ al@@ ay@@ as , I found children carrying stone for miles down mount@@ ain@@ ous terrain to truc@@ ks waiting at ro@@ ads below .
The big she@@ ets of s@@ late were heav@@ ier than the children carrying them , and the kids ho@@ is@@ ted them from their heads using these hand@@ made har@@ n@@ esses of stic@@ ks and ro@@ pe and tor@@ n cl@@ oth .
It &apos;s difficult to wit@@ ness something so over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming .
How can we affect something so insi@@ di@@ ous , yet so per@@ vas@@ ive ?
Some don &apos;t even know they &apos;re en@@ sl@@ av@@ ed , people working 16 , 17 hours a day without any pay , because this has been the case all their lives .
They have nothing to compare it to .
When these vill@@ agers cl@@ aim@@ ed their freedom , the sl@@ av@@ e@@ hol@@ ders bur@@ ned down all of their houses .
I mean , these people had nothing , and they were so pe@@ tri@@ fied , they wanted to give up , but the woman in the center r@@ alli@@ ed for them to pers@@ ev@@ ere , and abo@@ li@@ tion@@ ists on the ground helped them get a qu@@ arry lea@@ se of their own , so that now they do the same back@@ -@@ breaking work , but they do it for themselves , and they get paid for it , and they do it in freedom .
Se@@ x traff@@ ic@@ king is what we often think of when we hear the word sl@@ av@@ ery , and because of this worldwide awareness , I was war@@ ned that it would be difficult for me to work saf@@ ely within this particular industry .
In K@@ ath@@ man@@ du , I was es@@ cor@@ ted by women who had previ@@ ously been sex sl@@ aves themselves .
They us@@ her@@ ed me down a nar@@ row set of st@@ airs that led to this dir@@ ty , di@@ m@@ ly fluor@@ escent lit bas@@ ement .
This wasn &apos;t a bro@@ the@@ l , per se .
It was more like a restaurant .
C@@ ab@@ in restaur@@ ants , as they &apos;re known in the trade , are ven@@ ues for forced prostitu@@ tion .
Each has small , private rooms , where the sl@@ aves , women , along with young girls and boys , some as young as seven years old , are forced to entert@@ ain the clients , encour@@ aging them to buy more food and al@@ co@@ ho@@ l .
Each cu@@ bic@@ le is dark and d@@ ing@@ y , identi@@ fied with a pain@@ ted number on the wall , and parti@@ tion@@ ed by pl@@ y@@ wood and a cur@@ t@@ ain .
The workers here often end@@ ure trag@@ ic sexual ab@@ use at the hands of their custom@@ ers .
St@@ anding in the near dark@@ ness , I remember feeling this quick , hot fear , and in that instant , I could only imagine what it must be like to be tr@@ apped in that hell .
I had only one way out : the st@@ airs from where I &apos;d come in .
There were no back do@@ ors .
There were no windo@@ ws large enough to clim@@ b through .
These people have no es@@ cape at all , and as we take in such a difficult subject , it &apos;s important to note that sl@@ av@@ ery , including sex traff@@ ic@@ king , occu@@ rs in our own back@@ y@@ ard as well .
T@@ ens of hundreds of people are en@@ sl@@ av@@ ed in agriculture , in restaur@@ ants , in domes@@ tic serv@@ itude , and the list can go on .
R@@ ec@@ ently , the New York Times re@@ ported that between 100,000 and 3@@ 00,000 American children are sold into sex sl@@ av@@ ery every year .
It &apos;s all around us . We just don &apos;t see it .
The tex@@ tile industry is another one we often think of when we hear about sl@@ ave labor .
I vis@@ ited villages in India where entire families were en@@ sl@@ av@@ ed in the sil@@ k trade .
This is a family por@@ trait .
The dy@@ ed black hands are the father , while the blue and red hands are his sons .
They mi@@ x dy@@ e in these big bar@@ rels , and they sub@@ mer@@ ge the sil@@ k into the liqui@@ d up to their el@@ bo@@ ws , but the dy@@ e is tox@@ ic .
My inter@@ pre@@ ter told me their stories .
&quot; We have no freedom , &quot; they said .
&quot; We hope still , though , that we could leave this house some@@ day and go some@@ place else where we actually get paid for our dy@@ e@@ ing . &quot;
It &apos;s estim@@ ated that more than 4@@ ,000 children are en@@ sl@@ av@@ ed on L@@ ake V@@ ol@@ ta , the largest man@@ -@@ made la@@ ke in the world .
When we first arrived , I went to have a quick look .
I saw what seemed to be a family fishing on a boat , two older bro@@ thers , some youn@@ ger kids , makes sense right ?
W@@ r@@ ong . They were all en@@ sl@@ av@@ ed .
Chil@@ dren are taken from their families and traff@@ ic@@ ked and van@@ ished , and they &apos;re forced to work end@@ less hours on these bo@@ ats on the la@@ ke , even though they do not know how to swi@@ m .
This young child is eight years old .
He was trem@@ bling when our boat appro@@ ach@@ ed , fri@@ ghten@@ ed it would run over his tiny can@@ o@@ e .
He was pe@@ tri@@ fied he would be kno@@ c@@ ked in the water .
The sk@@ el@@ et@@ al tree lim@@ bs sub@@ mer@@ ged in L@@ ake V@@ ol@@ ta often catch the fishing nets , and w@@ ear@@ y , fri@@ ghten@@ ed children are thro@@ wn into the water to un@@ te@@ ther the lines .
Many of them dro@@ wn .
For as long as he can rec@@ all , he &apos;s been forced to work on the la@@ ke .
Ter@@ ri@@ fied of his master , he will not run away , and since he &apos;s been treated with cru@@ el@@ ty all his life , he pas@@ ses that down to the youn@@ ger sl@@ aves that he man@@ ages .
I met these boys at five in the morning , when they were hau@@ ling in the last of their nets , but they had been working since 1 a@@ .@@ m .
in the cold , win@@ dy night .
And it &apos;s important to note that these nets we@@ igh more than a thousand pounds when they &apos;re full of fish .
I want to introduce you to K@@ of@@ i .
K@@ of@@ i was res@@ cu@@ ed from a fishing village .
I met him at a shel@@ ter where F@@ ree the S@@ l@@ aves re@@ h@@ abil@@ it@@ ates victims of sl@@ av@@ ery .
Here he &apos;s seen taking a bat@@ h at the well , pour@@ ing big bu@@ ck@@ ets of water over his head , and the wonderful news is , as you and I are sitting here talking today , K@@ of@@ i has been re@@ un@@ ited with his family , and what &apos;s even better , his family has been given tools to make a living and to keep their children safe .
K@@ of@@ i is the em@@ bo@@ di@@ ment of possibility .
Who will he become because someone took a stand and made a difference in his life ?
D@@ ri@@ ving down a road in Ghana with part@@ ners of F@@ ree the S@@ l@@ aves , a fellow abo@@ li@@ tion@@ ist on a mo@@ ped suddenly sp@@ ed up to our cru@@ iser and t@@ apped on the window .
He told us to follow him down a dir@@ t road into the jun@@ gle .
At the end of the road , he ur@@ ged us out of the car , and told the driver to quickly leave .
Then he poin@@ ted toward this bar@@ ely visible foot@@ path , and said , &quot; This is the path , this is the path . Go . &quot;
As we started down the path , we push@@ ed as@@ ide the v@@ ines bloc@@ king the way , and after about an hour of walking in , found that the tr@@ ail had become f@@ loo@@ ded by recent r@@ ains , so I ho@@ is@@ ted the photo g@@ ear above my head as we desc@@ ended into these wat@@ ers up to my ch@@ est .
After another two hours of hi@@ king , the win@@ ding tr@@ ail ab@@ rup@@ tly ended at a clear@@ ing , and before us was a mass of holes that could fit into the size of a football field , and all of them were full of en@@ sl@@ av@@ ed people labor@@ ing .
Many women had children str@@ apped to their b@@ acks while they were p@@ ann@@ ing for gold , w@@ ad@@ ing in water pois@@ oned by mer@@ cur@@ y .
Mer@@ cur@@ y is used in the extr@@ action process .
These min@@ ers are en@@ sl@@ av@@ ed in a mine sh@@ aft in another part of Ghana .
When they came out of the sh@@ aft , they were so@@ aking w@@ et from their own swe@@ at .
I remember looking into their ti@@ red , bloo@@ d@@ shot eyes , for many of them had been under@@ ground for 7@@ 2 hours .
The sh@@ af@@ ts are up to 300 feet deep , and they carry out heavy b@@ ags of stone that later will be trans@@ ported to another area , where the stone will be pou@@ n@@ ded so that they can extr@@ act the gold .
At first gl@@ ance , the pou@@ n@@ ding site seems full of powerful men , but when we look closer , we see some less fortun@@ ate working on the fr@@ ing@@ es , and children too .
All of them are victi@@ m to inj@@ ury , ill@@ ness and violence .
In fact , it &apos;s very likely that this mus@@ cul@@ ar person will end up like this one here , rac@@ ked with tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mer@@ cur@@ y pois@@ oning in just a few years .
This is Man@@ ur@@ u . When his father died , his un@@ cle traff@@ ic@@ ked him to work with him in the min@@ es .
When his un@@ cle died , Man@@ ur@@ u inher@@ ited his un@@ cle &apos;s deb@@ t , which further forced him into being en@@ sl@@ av@@ ed in the min@@ es .
When I met him , he had been working in the min@@ es for 14 years , and the leg inj@@ ury that you see here is actually from a min@@ ing accident , one so sev@@ ere doctors say his leg should be am@@ put@@ ated .
On top of that , Man@@ ur@@ u has tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis , yet he &apos;s still forced to work day in and day out in that mine sh@@ aft .
Even still , he has a dream that he will become free and become educ@@ ated with the help of local activis@@ ts like F@@ ree the S@@ l@@ aves , and it &apos;s this sort of determin@@ ation , in the face of un@@ imagin@@ able od@@ ds , that f@@ ills me with complete a@@ we .
I want to sh@@ ine a light on sl@@ av@@ ery .
When I was working in the field , I brought lots of c@@ and@@ les with me , and with the help of my inter@@ pre@@ ter , I im@@ par@@ ted to the people I was photograph@@ ing that I wanted to illu@@ min@@ ate their stories and their p@@ light , so when it was safe for them , and safe for me , I made these images .
They knew their image would be seen by you out in the world .
I wanted them to know that we will be be@@ ar@@ ing wit@@ ness to them , and that we will do whatever we can to help make a difference in their lives .
I truly believe , if we can see one another as fellow human beings , then it becomes very difficult to tol@@ er@@ ate a@@ tro@@ cities like sl@@ av@@ ery .
These images are not of issues . They are of people , real people , like you and me , all des@@ er@@ ving of the same rights , dign@@ ity and respect in their lives .
There is not a day that goes by that I don &apos;t think of these many beautiful , m@@ ist@@ re@@ ated people I &apos;ve had the tremendous hon@@ or of meeting .
I hope that these images aw@@ ak@@ en a force in those who view them , people like you , and I hope that force will ign@@ ite a fire , and that fire will sh@@ ine a light on sl@@ av@@ ery , for without that light , the be@@ ast of bon@@ d@@ age can continue to live in the sh@@ ado@@ ws .
Thank you very much .
So , well , I do appli@@ ed math , and this is a p@@ ecu@@ li@@ ar problem for anyone who does appli@@ ed math , is that we are like management consul@@ t@@ ants .
No one knows what the hell we do .
So I am going to give you some -- attemp@@ t today to try and explain to you what I do .
So , d@@ ancing is one of the most human of acti@@ vi@@ ties .
We deli@@ ght at ball@@ et virtu@@ o@@ so@@ s and ta@@ p d@@ anc@@ ers you will see later on .
Now , ball@@ et requires an extraordinary level of exper@@ tise and a high level of sk@@ ill , and probably a level of initi@@ al su@@ it@@ ability that may well have a genetic compon@@ ent to it .
Now , s@@ ad@@ ly , neuro@@ logical dis@@ orders such as Par@@ kin@@ son &apos;s disease gradu@@ ally destro@@ y this extraordinary ability , as it is doing to my friend J@@ an S@@ tri@@ pl@@ ing , who was a virtu@@ o@@ so ball@@ et d@@ ancer in his time .
So great progress and treatment has been made over the years .
However , there are 6@@ .@@ 3 million people worldwide who have the disease , and they have to live with in@@ cur@@ able wea@@ k@@ ness , tre@@ mor , ri@@ gi@@ d@@ ity and the other sympt@@ oms that go along with the disease , so what we need are objec@@ tive tools to detect the disease before it &apos;s too late .
We need to be able to measure progr@@ ession objec@@ tively , and ultimately , the only way we &apos;re going to know when we actually have a cure is when we have an objec@@ tive measure that can answer that for sure .
But frustr@@ at@@ ingly , with Par@@ kin@@ son &apos;s disease and other movement dis@@ orders , there are no biom@@ ar@@ kers , so there &apos;s no simple blood test that you can do , and the best that we have is like this 20@@ -@@ minute neuro@@ logist test .
You have to go to the clin@@ ic to do it . It &apos;s very , very co@@ stly , and that means that , outside the clinical trials , it &apos;s just never done . It &apos;s never done .
But what if patients could do this test at home ?
Now , that would actually save on a difficult trip to the clin@@ ic , and what if patients could do that test themselves , right ?
No expensive staf@@ f time required .
T@@ akes about $ 300 , by the way , in the neuro@@ logist &apos;s clin@@ ic to do it .
So what I want to propose to you as an un@@ conventi@@ onal way in which we can try to achieve this , because , you see , in one sense , at least , we are all virtu@@ o@@ so@@ s like my friend J@@ an S@@ tri@@ pl@@ ing .
So here we have a video of the vibr@@ ating vo@@ cal fol@@ ds .
Now , this is healthy and this is somebody making speech sounds , and we can think of ourselves as vo@@ cal ball@@ et d@@ anc@@ ers , because we have to coordin@@ ate all of these vo@@ cal org@@ ans when we make sounds , and we all actually have the genes for it . F@@ ox@@ P@@ 2 , for example .
And like ball@@ et , it takes an extraordinary level of training .
I mean , just think how long it takes a child to learn to speak .
From the sound , we can actually track the vo@@ cal fold position as it vibr@@ ates , and just as the lim@@ bs are affected in Par@@ kin@@ son &apos;s , so too are the vo@@ cal org@@ ans .
So on the bottom trace , you can see an example of ir@@ regular vo@@ cal fold tre@@ mor .
We see all the same sympt@@ oms .
We see vo@@ cal tre@@ mor , wea@@ k@@ ness and ri@@ gi@@ d@@ ity .
The speech actually becomes qui@@ eter and more bre@@ ath@@ y after a while , and that &apos;s one of the example sympt@@ oms of it .
So these vo@@ cal effects can actually be quite sub@@ tle , in some cases , but with any digital micro@@ phone , and using precis@@ ion voice analysis software in combin@@ ation with the lat@@ est in machine learning , which is very advanced by now , we can now quanti@@ fy exactly where somebody lies on a continu@@ um between health and disease using voice signals alone .
So these vo@@ ic@@ e-@@ based tests , how do they st@@ ack up against expert clinical tests ? We &apos;ll , they &apos;re both non-@@ invas@@ ive .
The neuro@@ logist &apos;s test is non-@@ invas@@ ive . They both use existing infrastructure .
You don &apos;t have to design a whole new set of hospitals to do it .
And they &apos;re both accur@@ ate . Okay , but in addition , vo@@ ic@@ e-@@ based tests are non-@@ expert .
That means they can be self-@@ ad@@ min@@ is@@ tered .
They &apos;re high-@@ speed , take about 30 seconds at most .
They &apos;re ul@@ tra@@ -@@ low cost , and we all know what happens .
When something becomes ul@@ tra@@ -@@ low cost , it becomes mas@@ sively sc@@ al@@ able .
So here are some amazing goals that I think we can deal with now .
We can reduce log@@ is@@ tical difficul@@ ties with patients .
No need to go to the clin@@ ic for a rout@@ ine chec@@ k@@ up .
We can do high-@@ frequ@@ ency monit@@ or@@ ing to get objec@@ tive data .
We can perform low-@@ cost mass recru@@ it@@ ment for clinical trials , and we can make popul@@ ation@@ -@@ scale scre@@ ening fe@@ as@@ ible for the first time .
We have the opportunity to start to search for the early biom@@ ar@@ kers of the disease before it &apos;s too late .
So , taking the first steps towards this today , we &apos;re laun@@ ching the Par@@ kin@@ son &apos;s Vo@@ ice I@@ ni@@ ti@@ ative .
With A@@ cul@@ ab and P@@ ati@@ ent@@ s@@ Li@@ ke@@ M@@ e , we &apos;re aim@@ ing to record a very large number of voices worldwide to collect enough data to start to t@@ ack@@ le these four goals .
We have local numbers accessible to three quar@@ ters of a billion people on the planet .
Any@@ one healthy or with Par@@ kin@@ son &apos;s can call in , chea@@ ply , and leave recor@@ dings , a few cents each , and I &apos;m really happy to ann@@ oun@@ ce that we &apos;ve already hit six percent of our target just in eight hours .
Thank you . Tom Ri@@ el@@ ly : So Ma@@ x , by taking all these sam@@ ples of , let &apos;s say , 10,000 people , you &apos;ll be able to tell who &apos;s healthy and who &apos;s not ?
What are you going to get out of those sam@@ ples ?
Ma@@ x L@@ it@@ tle : Yeah . Yeah . So what will happen is that , during the call you have to indic@@ ate whether or not you have the disease or not , you see . T@@ R : Right .
M@@ L : You see , some people may not do it . They may not get through it .
But we &apos;ll get a very large sam@@ ple of data that is coll@@ ected from all different circumst@@ ances , and it &apos;s getting it in different circumst@@ ances that matter because then we are looking at iron@@ ing out the conf@@ oun@@ ding factors , and looking for the actual mark@@ ers of the disease .
T@@ R : So you &apos;re 8@@ 6 percent accur@@ ate right now ?
M@@ L : It &apos;s much better than that .
Actually , my student Th@@ an@@ as@@ is , I have to plu@@ g him , because he &apos;s done some fantastic work , and now he has pro@@ ved that it works over the mobile tele@@ phone network as well , which en@@ ables this project , and we &apos;re getting 99 percent accur@@ acy .
T@@ R : N@@ in@@ et@@ y-@@ nine . Well , that &apos;s an impro@@ vement .
So what that means is that people will be able to — M@@ L : T@@ R : People will be able to call in from their mobile phones and do this test , and people with Par@@ kin@@ son &apos;s could call in , record their voice , and then their doctor can check up on their progress , see where they &apos;re doing in this course of the disease .
M@@ L : Ab@@ solu@@ tely .
T@@ R : Thanks so much . Ma@@ x L@@ it@@ tle , everybody .
M@@ L : Thanks , Tom .
Be@@ fore Mar@@ ch , 2011 , I was a photographi@@ c re@@ tou@@ cher based in New York City .
We &apos;re p@@ ale , gr@@ ay creatures .
We hide in dark , win@@ dow@@ less rooms , and gener@@ ally avoid sun@@ light .
We make sk@@ in@@ ny models sk@@ in@@ ni@@ er , perfect skin more perfect , and the impossible possible , and we get cri@@ tici@@ zed in the press all the time , but some of us are actually tal@@ ented artists with years of experience and a real appreci@@ ation for images and photograph@@ y .
On Mar@@ ch 11 , 2011 , I watched from home , as the rest of the world did , as the trag@@ ic events un@@ fol@@ ded in Japan .
So@@ on after , an organization I volunte@@ er with , All H@@ ands V@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , were on the ground , within days , working as part of the response efforts .
I , along with hundreds of other volunte@@ ers , knew we couldn &apos;t just sit at home , so I decided to join them for three weeks .
On M@@ ay the 1@@ 3@@ th , I made my way to the town of Ō@@ fun@@ a@@ to .
It &apos;s a small fishing town in I@@ w@@ ate P@@ ref@@ ec@@ ture , about 5@@ 0,000 people , one of the first that was hit by the wave .
The wat@@ ers here have been recor@@ ded at reach@@ ing over 24 meters in he@@ ight , and trav@@ eled over two miles in@@ land .
As you can imagine , the town had been dev@@ ast@@ ated .
We pul@@ led de@@ br@@ is from can@@ als and dit@@ ches .
We clean@@ ed schools . We de-@@ mu@@ d@@ ded and gu@@ t@@ ted homes ready for ren@@ o@@ vation and re@@ h@@ abil@@ itation .
We clear@@ ed tons and tons of st@@ inking , rot@@ ting fish car@@ cas@@ ses from the local fish proc@@ essing plant .
We got dir@@ ty , and we loved it .
For weeks , all the volunte@@ ers and loc@@ als ali@@ ke had been finding similar things .
They &apos;d been finding photos and photo al@@ bu@@ ms and cameras and S@@ D cards .
And everyone was doing the same .
They were collec@@ ting them up , and h@@ anding them in to various places around the different to@@ w@@ ns for sa@@ fe@@ keeping .
Now , it wasn &apos;t until this point that I realized that these photos were such a huge part of the personal loss these people had felt .
As they had run from the wave , and for their lives , absolutely everything they had , everything had to be left behind .
At the end of my first week there , I found myself helping out in an ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ation center in the town .
I was helping clean the on@@ sen , the commun@@ al on@@ sen , the huge giant b@@ ath@@ tu@@ bs .
This happened to also be a place in the town where the ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ation center was collec@@ ting the photos .
This is where people were h@@ anding them in , and I was hon@@ o@@ red that day that they actually tru@@ st@@ ed me to help them start hand@@ -@@ clean@@ ing them .
Now , it was emotional and it was inspir@@ ing , and I &apos;ve always heard about thinking outside the box , but it wasn &apos;t until I had actually gotten outside of my box that something happened .
As I looked through the photos , there were some were over a hundred years old , some still in the envelop@@ e from the proc@@ essing lab , I couldn &apos;t help but think as a re@@ tou@@ cher that I could fix that t@@ ear and m@@ end that scr@@ atch , and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same .
So that even@@ ing , I just reach@@ ed out on Facebook and asked a few of them , and by morning the response had been so over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming and so positive , I knew we had to give it a go .
So we started re@@ tou@@ ching photos .
This was the very first .
Not terri@@ bly dam@@ aged , but where the water had caused that dis@@ color@@ ation on the girl &apos;s face had to be re@@ pai@@ red with such accur@@ acy and del@@ ic@@ acy .
O@@ ther@@ wise , that little girl isn &apos;t going to look like that little girl anymore , and su@@ rely that &apos;s as trag@@ ic as having the photo dam@@ aged .
Over time , more photos came in , th@@ ank@@ fully , and more re@@ tou@@ chers were needed , and so I reach@@ ed out again on Facebook and Lin@@ ke@@ d@@ In , and within five days , 80 people wanted to help from 12 different countries .
Wi@@ thin two weeks , I had 150 people wan@@ ting to join in .
Wi@@ thin Japan , by Ju@@ ly , we &apos;d bran@@ ched out to the neighbor@@ ing town of Ri@@ k@@ u@@ z@@ ent@@ ak@@ ata , further nor@@ th to a town called Y@@ am@@ ada .
Once a week , we would set up our scann@@ ing equipment in the tempor@@ ary photo libr@@ aries that had been set up , where people were re@@ cl@@ aim@@ ing their photos .
The older la@@ dies sometimes hadn &apos;t seen a scanner before , but within 10 minutes of them finding their lost photo , they could give it to us , have it scann@@ ed , u@@ pl@@ o@@ aded to a cloud server , it would be down@@ lo@@ aded by a g@@ ai@@ j@@ in , a str@@ anger , somewhere on the other side of the globe , and it &apos;d start being fix@@ ed .
The time it took , how@@ ever , to get it back is a completely different story , and it depend@@ ed obviously on the damage involved .
It could take an hour . It could take weeks .
It could take months .
The k@@ im@@ on@@ o in this shot pretty much had to be hand@@ -@@ dra@@ wn , or pi@@ ec@@ ed together , pic@@ king out the re@@ main@@ ing parts of color and detail that the water hadn &apos;t dam@@ aged .
It was very ti@@ me-@@ consum@@ ing .
Now , all these photos had been dam@@ aged by water , sub@@ mer@@ ged in sal@@ t water , covered in bacteria , in se@@ w@@ age , sometimes even in oil , all of which over time is going to continue to damage them , so hand@@ -@@ clean@@ ing them was a huge part of the project .
We couldn &apos;t re@@ touch the photo unless it was clean@@ ed , dry and re@@ cl@@ aim@@ ed .
Now , we were lucky with our hand@@ -@@ clean@@ ing .
We had an amazing local woman who gu@@ ided us .
It &apos;s very easy to do more damage to those dam@@ aged photos .
As my team leader W@@ yn@@ ne once said , it &apos;s like doing a tat@@ too on someone .
You don &apos;t get a chance to m@@ ess it up .
The lady who brought us these photos was lucky , as far as the photos go .
She had started hand@@ -@@ clean@@ ing them her@@ self and stopped when she realized she was doing more damage .
She also had du@@ plic@@ ates .
A@@ re@@ as like her husband and her face , which otherwise would have been completely impossible to fix , we could just put them together in one good photo , and re@@ make the whole photo .
When she coll@@ ected the photos from us , she shared a bit of her story with us .
Her photos were found by her husband &apos;s colleagues at a local fire de@@ partment in the de@@ br@@ is a long way from where the home had once stood , and they &apos;d recogni@@ zed him .
The day of the t@@ su@@ nam@@ i , he &apos;d actually been in charge of making sure the t@@ su@@ nam@@ i g@@ ates were closed .
He had to go towards the water as the si@@ r@@ ens sou@@ n@@ ded .
Her two little boys , not so little anymore , but her two boys were both at school , separate schools .
One of them got caught up in the water .
It took her a week to find them all again and find out that they had all surviv@@ ed .
The day I gave her the photos also happened to be her youn@@ g@@ est son &apos;s 14@@ th bir@@ th@@ day .
For her , despite all of this , those photos were the perfect gi@@ ft back to him , something he could look at again , something he rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ed from before that wasn &apos;t still scar@@ red from that day in Mar@@ ch when absolutely everything else in his life had changed or been destro@@ yed .
After six months in Japan , 1,@@ 100 volunte@@ ers had passed through All H@@ ands , hundreds of whom had helped us hand@@ -@@ clean over 1@@ 3@@ 5,000 photograph@@ s , the large majority — — a large majority of which did actually find their home again , importantly .
Over five hundred volunte@@ ers around the globe helped us get 90 families hundreds of photograph@@ s back , fully res@@ to@@ red and re@@ tou@@ ched .
Dur@@ ing this time , we hadn &apos;t really spent more than about a thousand dollars in equipment and materials , most of which was prin@@ ter in@@ ks .
We take photos constantly .
A photo is a re@@ min@@ der of someone or something , a place , a relationship , a loved one .
They &apos;re our mem@@ or@@ y-@@ kee@@ pers and our hist@@ ories , the last thing we would gra@@ b and the first thing you &apos;d go back to look for .
That &apos;s all this project was about , about rest@@ or@@ ing those little bits of humanity , giving someone that connection back .
When a photo like this can be re@@ turned to someone like this , it makes a huge difference in the lives of the person rece@@ iv@@ ing it .
The project &apos;s also made a big difference in the lives of the re@@ tou@@ chers .
For some of them , it &apos;s given them a connection to something bigger , giving something back , using their talents on something other than sk@@ in@@ ny models and perfect skin .
I would like to conclu@@ de by reading an email I got from one of them , C@@ in@@ dy , the day I finally got back from Japan after six months .
&quot; As I worked , I couldn &apos;t help but think about the individuals and the stories repres@@ ented in the images .
One in particular , a photo of women of all ages , from grandmother to little girl , gath@@ ered around a baby , struc@@ k a ch@@ ord , because a similar photo from my family , my grandmother and mother , myself , and new@@ born daughter , h@@ ang@@ s on our wall .
A@@ cross the globe , throughout the ages , our basic needs are just the same , aren &apos;t they ? &quot;
Thank you .
Do@@ c Ed@@ ger@@ ton inspired us with a@@ we and curios@@ ity with this photo of a bul@@ let pi@@ er@@ c@@ ing through an app@@ le , and expos@@ ure just a milli@@ on@@ th of a second .
But now , 50 years later , we can go a million times faster and see the world not at a million or a billion , but one trillion fr@@ ames per second .
I present to you a new type of photograph@@ y , fem@@ to-@@ photograph@@ y , a new imag@@ ing technique so fast that it can create slow motion videos of light in motion .
And with that , we can create cameras that can look around cor@@ ners , beyond line of sight , or see inside our body without an x@@ -@@ ray , and really challenge what we mean by a camera .
Now if I take a laser poin@@ ter and turn it on and off in one trilli@@ on@@ th of a second -- which is several fem@@ to@@ seconds -- I &apos;ll create a pack@@ et of phot@@ ons bar@@ ely a milli@@ meter wide .
And that pack@@ et of phot@@ ons , that bul@@ let , will travel at the speed of light , and again , a million times faster than an ordinary bul@@ let .
Now , if you take that bul@@ let and take this pack@@ et of phot@@ ons and fire into this bot@@ tle , how will those phot@@ ons sh@@ at@@ ter into this bot@@ tle ?
How does light look in slow motion ?
&#91; L@@ ight in S@@ low Mo@@ tion ... 10 B@@ illi@@ on x S@@ low &#93; Now , the whole event -- Now remember , the whole event is effectively taking place in less than a nan@@ o@@ second -- that &apos;s how much time it takes for light to travel .
But I &apos;m s@@ lowing down in this video by a fac@@ tor of 10 billion , so you can see the light in motion .
But C@@ oc@@ a-@@ Co@@ la did not spon@@ s@@ or this research .
Now , there &apos;s a lot going on in this movie , so let me break this down and show you what &apos;s going on .
So the pul@@ se ent@@ ers the bot@@ tle , our bul@@ let , with a pack@@ et of phot@@ ons that start trav@@ eling through and that start sc@@ at@@ ter@@ ing inside .
Some of the light lea@@ ks , goes on the table , and you start seeing these ri@@ p@@ ples of waves .
Many of the phot@@ ons eventually reach the ca@@ p and then they explo@@ de in various directions .
As you can see , there &apos;s a bu@@ bble of air and it &apos;s b@@ ounc@@ ing around inside .
Me@@ an@@ while , the ri@@ p@@ ples are trav@@ eling on the table , and because of the refl@@ ections at the top , you see at the back of the bot@@ tle , after several fr@@ ames , the refl@@ ections are focused .
Now , if you take an ordinary bul@@ let and let it go the same distance and slow down the video -- again , by a fac@@ tor of 10 billion -- do you know how long you &apos;ll have to sit here to watch that movie ?
A day , a week ? Actually , a whole year .
It &apos;ll be a very bor@@ ing movie -- of a slow , ordinary bul@@ let in motion .
And what about some s@@ till@@ -@@ life photograph@@ y ?
You can watch the ri@@ p@@ ples , again , wash@@ ing over the table , the tom@@ a@@ to and the wall in the back .
It &apos;s like thro@@ wing a stone in a pond of water .
I thought : this is how nature pain@@ ts a photo , one fem@@ to frame at a time , but of course our eye sees an integr@@ al compos@@ ite .
But if you look at this tom@@ a@@ to one more time , you will notice , as the light wash@@ es over the tom@@ a@@ to , it contin@@ ues to g@@ low . It doesn &apos;t become dark . Why is that ?
Because the tom@@ a@@ to is actually ri@@ pe , and the light is b@@ ounc@@ ing around inside the tom@@ a@@ to , and it comes out after several trilli@@ on@@ ths of a second .
So in the future , when this fem@@ to-@@ camera is in your camera phone , you might be able to go to a super@@ market and check if the fruit is ri@@ pe without actually tou@@ ching it .
So how did my team at MIT create this camera ?
Now , as photograph@@ ers , you know , if you take a short expos@@ ure photo , you get very little light .
But we &apos;re going to go a billion times faster than your shor@@ test expos@@ ure , so you &apos;re going to get har@@ dly any light .
So what we do is we send that bul@@ let -- that pack@@ et of phot@@ ons -- millions of times , and record again and again with very cl@@ ever syn@@ chron@@ ization , and from the gig@@ ab@@ y@@ tes of data , to create those fem@@ to-@@ videos I showed you .
And we can take all that ra@@ w data and treat it in very interesting ways .
So , Su@@ per@@ man can fly .
Some other her@@ oes can become invisible .
But what about a new power for a future super@@ her@@ o : To see around cor@@ ners .
The idea is that we could sh@@ ine some light on the door , it &apos;s going to boun@@ ce , go inside the room , some of that is going to refl@@ ect back on the door , and then back to the camera .
And we could explo@@ it these multiple boun@@ ces of light .
And it &apos;s not science fiction . We have actually built it .
On the left , you see our fem@@ to-@@ camera .
There &apos;s a man@@ ne@@ qu@@ in hidden behind a wall , and we &apos;re going to boun@@ ce light off the door .
So after our paper was published in Nature Com@@ mun@@ ic@@ ations , it was high@@ li@@ gh@@ ted by N@@ atu@@ re@@ .com , and they created this animation .
R@@ am@@ esh R@@ as@@ k@@ ar : We &apos;re going to fire those bul@@ lets of light , and they &apos;re going to hit this wall , and because of the pack@@ et of the phot@@ ons , they will sc@@ at@@ ter in all the directions , and some of them will reach our hidden man@@ ne@@ qu@@ in , which in turn will again sc@@ at@@ ter that light , and again in turn , the door will refl@@ ect some of that sc@@ at@@ tered light .
And a tiny fr@@ action of the phot@@ ons will actually come back to the camera , but most inter@@ est@@ ingly , they will all arrive at a slightly different time s@@ lot .
And because we have a camera that can run so fast -- our fem@@ to-@@ camera -- it has some unique abilities .
It has very good time resol@@ ution , and it can look at the world at the speed of light .
And this way , we know the dist@@ ances , of course to the door , but also to the hidden objects , but we don &apos;t know which point correspon@@ ds to which distance .
By sh@@ in@@ ing one laser , we can record one ra@@ w photo , which , if you look on the screen , doesn &apos;t really make any sense .
But then we will take a lot of such pictures , do@@ z@@ ens of such pictures , put them together , and try to analy@@ ze the multiple boun@@ ces of light , and from that , can we see the hidden object ?
Can we see it in full 3D ?
So this is our re@@ construction .
Now , we have some ways to go before we take this outside the lab on the road , but in the future , we could create cars that avoid coll@@ isions with what &apos;s around the b@@ end .
Or we can look for surviv@@ ors in h@@ az@@ ard@@ ous conditions by looking at light refl@@ ected through open windo@@ ws .
Or we can build end@@ o@@ sc@@ opes that can see deep inside the body around oc@@ clu@@ ders , and also for cardi@@ o@@ sc@@ opes .
But of course , because of tissue and blood , this is quite challeng@@ ing , so this is really a call for scientists to start thinking about fem@@ to-@@ photograph@@ y as really a new imag@@ ing mod@@ ality to solve the next generation of health@@ -@@ imag@@ ing problems .
Now , like Do@@ c Ed@@ ger@@ ton , a scientist himself , science became art -- an art of ul@@ tra@@ -@@ fast photograph@@ y .
And I realized that all the gig@@ ab@@ y@@ tes of data that we &apos;re collec@@ ting every time , are not just for scientific imag@@ ing .
But we can also do a new form of compu@@ t@@ ational photograph@@ y , with ti@@ me-@@ lap@@ se and color co@@ ding .
And we look at those ri@@ p@@ ples . Rem@@ ember : The time between each of those ri@@ p@@ ples is only a few trilli@@ on@@ ths of a second .
But there &apos;s also something funny going on here .
When you look at the ri@@ p@@ ples under the ca@@ p , the ri@@ p@@ ples are moving away from us .
The ri@@ p@@ ples should be moving towards us .
What &apos;s going on here ?
It turns out , because we &apos;re recor@@ ding nearly at the speed of light , we have strange effects , and Einstein would have loved to see this picture .
The order at which events take place in the world appe@@ ars in the camera sometimes in re@@ vers@@ ed order .
So by appl@@ ying the correspon@@ ding space and time war@@ p , we can correct for this dist@@ or@@ tion .
So whether it &apos;s for photograph@@ y around cor@@ ners , or creating the next generation of health imag@@ ing , or creating new visu@@ aliz@@ ations , since our invention , we have open-@@ sour@@ c@@ ed all the data and details on our website , and our hope is that the D@@ I@@ Y , the creative and the research communities will show us that we should stop obs@@ essing about the me@@ g@@ ap@@ i@@ x@@ els in cameras -- and start foc@@ using on the next dimension in imag@@ ing .
It &apos;s about time . Thank you .
H@@ i . This is my mobile phone .
A mobile phone can change your life , and a mobile phone gives you individual freedom .
With a mobile phone , you can sho@@ ot a crime against humanity in Sy@@ ri@@ a .
With a mobile phone , you can twe@@ et a message and start a prot@@ est in Egy@@ pt .
And with a mobile phone , you can record a song , load it up to S@@ ound@@ Cl@@ oud and become famous .
All this is possible with your mobile phone .
I &apos;m a child of 198@@ 4 , and I live in the city of Ber@@ lin .
Let &apos;s go back to that time , to this city .
Here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people stood up and prot@@ ested for change .
This is au@@ tum@@ n 198@@ 9 , and imagine that all those people standing up and prot@@ esting for change had a mobile phone in their po@@ cket .
Who in the room has a mobile phone with you ?
H@@ old it up .
H@@ old your phones up , hold your phones up !
H@@ old it up . An An@@ dro@@ id , a Bl@@ ack@@ ber@@ ry , w@@ ow .
That &apos;s a lot . Al@@ most everybody today has a mobile phone .
But today I will talk about me and my mobile phone , and how it changed my life .
And I will talk about this .
These are 3@@ 5@@ ,@@ 8@@ 30 lines of information .
R@@ a@@ w data .
And why are these inform@@ ations there ?
Because in the summer of 2006 , the E@@ .@@ U@@ . Com@@ mission tab@@ led a direc@@ tive .
This direc@@ tive &#91; is &#93; called D@@ ata R@@ et@@ en@@ tion Di@@ rec@@ tive .
This direc@@ tive says that each phone company in Europe , each Internet service company all over Europe , has to store a wide range of information about the users .
Who calls whom ? Who s@@ ends whom an email ?
Who s@@ ends whom a text message ?
And if you use your mobile phone , where you are .
All this information is sto@@ red for at least six months , or your Internet service provi@@ der .
And all over Europe , people stood up and said , &quot; We don &apos;t want this . &quot;
They said , we don &apos;t want this data re@@ ten@@ tion .
We want self-@@ determin@@ ation in the digital age , and we don &apos;t want that phone companies and Internet companies have to store all this information about us .
They were law@@ yers , journalis@@ ts , pri@@ ests , they all said : &quot; We don &apos;t want this . &quot;
And here you can see , like 10 thousands of people went out on the streets of Ber@@ lin and said , &quot; Fre@@ e@@ dom , not fear . &quot;
And some even said , this would be St@@ as@@ i 2.@@ 0 .
St@@ as@@ i was the secret police in East Germany .
And I also ask myself , does it really work ?
Can they really store all this information about us ?
Every time I use my mobile phone ?
So I asked my phone company , D@@ eu@@ t@@ s@@ che T@@ ele@@ k@@ om , which was at that time the largest phone company in Germany , and I asked them , please , send me all the information you have sto@@ red about me .
And I asked them once , and I asked them again , and I got no real answer . It was only bl@@ ah bl@@ ah answers .
But then I said , I want to have this information , because this is my life you are prot@@ oc@@ ol@@ ing .
So I decided to start a law@@ suit against them , because I wanted to have this information .
But D@@ eu@@ t@@ s@@ che T@@ ele@@ k@@ om said , no , we will not give you this information .
So at the end , I had a sett@@ lement with them .
I &apos;ll put down the law@@ suit and they will send me all the information I ask for .
Because in the mean time , the Ger@@ man Con@@ stitu@@ tional C@@ our@@ t r@@ ul@@ ed that the impl@@ ement@@ ation of this E@@ .@@ U@@ . direc@@ tive into Ger@@ man law was un@@ constitu@@ tional .
So I got this u@@ g@@ ly bro@@ wn envelop@@ e with a C@@ .@@ D@@ . inside .
And on the C@@ .@@ D@@ . , this was on .
Th@@ ir@@ ty@@ -@@ five thousand eight hundred thir@@ ty lines of information .
At first I saw it , and I said , okay , it &apos;s a huge file . Okay .
But then after a while I realized , this is my life .
This is six months of my life , into this file .
So I was a little bit s@@ ke@@ p@@ tical , what should I do with it ?
Because you can see where I am , where I sleep at night , what I am doing .
But then I said , I want to go out with this information .
I want to make them public .
Because I want to show the people what does data re@@ ten@@ tion mean .
So together with Z@@ e@@ it On@@ line and O@@ pen D@@ ata City , I did this .
This is a visu@@ alization of six months of my life .
You can zo@@ om in and zo@@ om out , you can wind back and fast forward .
You can see every step I take .
And you can even see how I go from Fr@@ ank@@ fur@@ t by train to Co@@ log@@ ne , and how often I call in between .
All this is possible with this information .
That &apos;s a little bit scar@@ y .
But it is not only about me .
It &apos;s about all of us .
First , it &apos;s only like , I call my wife and she calls me , and we talk to each other a couple of times .
And then there are some friends calling me , and they call each other .
And after a while you are calling you , and you are calling you , and you have this great communication network .
But you can see how your people are communic@@ ating with each other , what times they call each other , when they go to bed .
You can see all of this .
You can see the hu@@ bs , like who are the leaders in the group .
If you have access to this information , you can see what your society is doing .
If you have access to this information , you can control your society .
This is a blu@@ e@@ print for countries like China and Iran .
This is a blu@@ e@@ print how to sur@@ vey your society , because you know who talks to whom , who s@@ ends whom an email , all this is possible if you have access to this information .
And this information is sto@@ red for at least six months in Europe , up to two years .
Like I said at the beginning , imagine that all those people on the streets of Ber@@ lin in au@@ tum@@ n of 198@@ 9 had a mobile phone in their po@@ cket .
And the St@@ as@@ i would have known who took part at this prot@@ est , and if the St@@ as@@ i would have known who are the leaders behind it , this may never have happened .
The fall of the Ber@@ lin W@@ all would maybe not &#91; have been &#93; there .
And in the after@@ math , also not the fall of the I@@ r@@ on C@@ ur@@ t@@ ain .
Because today , state ag@@ encies and companies want to store as much information as they can get about us , online and off@@ line .
They want to have the possibility to track our lives , and they want to store them for all time .
But self-@@ determin@@ ation and living in the digital age is no contra@@ diction .
But you have to fight for your self-@@ determin@@ ation today .
You have to fight for it every day .
So , when you go home , tell your friends that priv@@ acy is a value of the 21@@ st century , and it &apos;s not out@@ d@@ ated .
When you go home , tell your repres@@ ent@@ ative only because companies and state ag@@ encies have the possibility to store certain information , they don &apos;t have to do it .
And if you don &apos;t believe me , ask your phone company what information they store about you .
So , in the future , every time you use your mobile phone , let it be a re@@ min@@ der to you that you have to fight for self-@@ determin@@ ation in the digital age .
Thank you .
H@@ ell@@ o , TED@@ Women , what &apos;s up .
Not good enough .
H@@ ell@@ o , TED@@ Women , what is up ?
My name is May@@ soon Z@@ ay@@ id , and I am not dr@@ un@@ k , but the doctor who deli@@ vered me was .
He cut my mom six different times in six different directions , suff@@ oc@@ ating poor little me in the process .
As a result , I have cer@@ ebr@@ al pal@@ s@@ y , which means I sh@@ ake all the time .
Look .
It &apos;s ex@@ hau@@ sting .
I &apos;m like Sh@@ ak@@ ira , Sh@@ ak@@ ira me@@ ets Mu@@ ham@@ ma@@ d Al@@ i .
C@@ P is not genetic .
It &apos;s not a birth def@@ ect . You can &apos;t catch it .
No one put a cur@@ se on my mother &apos;s u@@ ter@@ us , and I didn &apos;t get it because my parents are first cous@@ ins , which they are .
It only happens from accidents , like what happened to me on my birth day .
Now , I must war@@ n you , I &apos;m not inspir@@ ational .
And I don &apos;t want anyone in this room to feel bad for me , because at some point in your life , you have dre@@ am@@ t of being dis@@ ab@@ led .
Come on a journey with me .
It &apos;s Christ@@ mas E@@ ve , you &apos;re at the m@@ all , you &apos;re driving around in cir@@ cles looking for parking , and what do you see ?
Si@@ x@@ te@@ en empty han@@ dic@@ apped spaces .
And you &apos;re like , &quot; God , can &apos;t I just be a little dis@@ ab@@ led ? &quot;
Al@@ so , I &apos;ve got to tell you , I &apos;ve got 99 problems , and pal@@ s@@ y is just one .
If there was an O@@ p@@ pression O@@ lym@@ pic@@ s , I would win the gold me@@ d@@ al .
I &apos;m Palest@@ in@@ ian , Mus@@ li@@ m , I &apos;m female , I &apos;m dis@@ ab@@ led , and I live in New Jer@@ sey .
If you don &apos;t feel better about yourself , maybe you should .
C@@ li@@ ff@@ side Park , New Jer@@ sey is my hom@@ et@@ own .
I have always loved the fact that my hood and my aff@@ lic@@ tion share the same initi@@ als .
I also love the fact that if I wanted to walk from my house to New York City , I could .
A lot of people with C@@ P don &apos;t walk , but my parents didn &apos;t believe in &quot; can &apos;t . &quot;
My father &apos;s man@@ tra was , &quot; You can do it , yes you can can . &quot;
So , if my three older s@@ is@@ ters were mo@@ pping , I was mo@@ pping .
If my three older s@@ is@@ ters went to public school , my parents would sue the school system and gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ e that I went too , and if we didn &apos;t all get A &apos;s , we all got my mother &apos;s sli@@ p@@ per .
My father taught me how to walk when I was five years old by plac@@ ing my he@@ els on his feet and just walking .
Another tac@@ tic that he used is he would d@@ angle a dollar b@@ ill in front of me and have me cha@@ se it .
My inner stri@@ p@@ per was very strong .
Yeah . No , by the first day of kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten , I was walking like a cham@@ p who had been pun@@ ched one too many times .
Gro@@ wing up , there were only six Arab@@ s in my town , and they were all my family .
Now there are 20 Arab@@ s in town , and they are still all my family . I don &apos;t think anyone even noticed we weren &apos;t Ital@@ ian .
This was before 9 / 11 and before politicians thought it was appropri@@ ate to use &quot; I hate Mus@@ lim@@ s &quot; as a campaign s@@ log@@ an .
The people that I grew up with had no problem with my faith .
They did , how@@ ever , seem very concerned that I would star@@ ve to death during R@@ am@@ ad@@ an .
I would explain to them that I have enough f@@ at to live off of for three whole months , so fas@@ ting from sun@@ rise to sun@@ set is a piece of c@@ ake .
I have tap@@ -@@ d@@ anced on Bro@@ ad@@ way .
Yeah , on Bro@@ ad@@ way . It &apos;s crazy . My parents couldn &apos;t afford physical therapy , so they sent me to d@@ ancing school .
I learned how to dance in he@@ els , which means I can walk in he@@ els .
And I &apos;m from Jer@@ sey , and we are really concerned with being ch@@ ic , so if my friends w@@ ore he@@ els , so did I .
And when my friends went and spent their summer vac@@ ations on the Jer@@ sey S@@ hore , I did not .
I spent my sum@@ m@@ ers in a war zone , because my parents were afraid that if we didn &apos;t go back to Palest@@ ine every single summer , we &apos;d grow up to be Mad@@ onn@@ a .
Su@@ m@@ mer vac@@ ations often cons@@ is@@ ted of my father trying to he@@ al me , so I dr@@ ank de@@ er &apos;s mil@@ k , I had hot cu@@ ps on my back , I was d@@ un@@ ked in the D@@ ead Se@@ a , and I remember the water bur@@ ning my eyes and thinking , &quot; It &apos;s working ! It &apos;s working ! &quot;
But one miracle cure we did find was y@@ o@@ g@@ a .
I have to tell you , it &apos;s very bor@@ ing , but before I did y@@ o@@ g@@ a , I was a stand@@ -up com@@ e@@ di@@ an who can &apos;t stand up .
And now I can stand on my head .
My parents re@@ in@@ forced this notion that I could do anything , that no dream was impossible , and my dream was to be on the d@@ ay@@ time so@@ ap op@@ era &quot; Gen@@ eral Ho@@ sp@@ ital . &quot;
I went to college during affir@@ m@@ ative action and got a swe@@ et sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ ship to A@@ S@@ U , A@@ ri@@ z@@ on@@ a State University , because I fit every single quot@@ a .
I was like the p@@ et lem@@ u@@ r of the theater de@@ partment .
Everybody loved me .
I did all the less@@ -@@ th@@ an@@ -@@ intelligent kids &apos; hom@@ ework , I got A &apos;s in all of my classes , A &apos;s in all of their classes .
Every time I did a scene from &quot; The Gl@@ ass M@@ en@@ ag@@ erie , &quot; my profess@@ ors would we@@ ep .
But I never got c@@ ast .
Fin@@ ally , my sen@@ ior year , A@@ S@@ U decided to do a show called &quot; They D@@ ance Re@@ al S@@ low in J@@ ack@@ son . &quot;
It &apos;s a play about a girl with C@@ P .
I was a girl with C@@ P .
So I start sh@@ ou@@ ting from the ro@@ of@@ top@@ s , &quot; I &apos;m finally going to get a part !
I have cer@@ ebr@@ al pal@@ s@@ y !
F@@ ree at last ! F@@ ree at last !
Thank God al@@ mi@@ gh@@ ty , I &apos;m free at last ! &quot;
I didn &apos;t get the part .
S@@ her@@ ry Bro@@ wn got the part .
I went rac@@ ing to the head of the theater de@@ partment cr@@ ying hy@@ ster@@ ically , like someone shot my cat , to ask her why , and she said it was because they didn &apos;t think I could do the stun@@ ts .
I said , &quot; Ex@@ cu@@ se me , if I can &apos;t do the stun@@ ts , ne@@ ither can the character . &quot;
This was a part that I was literally born to play they gave it to a non-@@ pal@@ s@@ y ac@@ tr@@ ess .
Col@@ le@@ ge was im@@ it@@ ating life .
Hollywood has a sor@@ did history of cas@@ ting ab@@ le-@@ bo@@ died act@@ ors to play dis@@ ab@@ led on@@ screen .
U@@ pon gradu@@ ating , I moved back home , and my first acting gi@@ g was as an extra on a d@@ ay@@ time so@@ ap op@@ era .
My dream was coming true .
And I knew that I would be prom@@ ot@@ ed from &quot; D@@ iner D@@ iner &quot; to &quot; W@@ ack@@ y B@@ est Fri@@ end &quot; in no time .
But instead , I re@@ main@@ ed a gl@@ ori@@ fied piece of fur@@ n@@ iture that you could only recognize from the back of my head , and it became clear to me that cas@@ ting direc@@ tors didn &apos;t h@@ ire flu@@ ff@@ y , ethni@@ c , dis@@ ab@@ led act@@ ors .
They only hi@@ red perfect people .
But there were excep@@ tions to the rule .
I grew up watching Wh@@ o@@ op@@ i Gol@@ d@@ berg , Ro@@ se@@ an@@ ne Bar@@ r , El@@ l@@ en , and all of these women had one thing in common : they were com@@ e@@ di@@ ans .
So I became a com@@ ic .
My first gi@@ g was driving famous com@@ ics from New York City to shows in New Jer@@ sey , and I &apos;ll never forget the face of the first com@@ ic I ever dro@@ ve when he realized that he was spe@@ eding down the New Jer@@ sey Tur@@ n@@ pi@@ ke with a ch@@ ick with C@@ P driving him .
I &apos;ve perform@@ ed in clu@@ bs all over America , and I &apos;ve also perform@@ ed in Arab@@ ic in the Middle East , un@@ cen@@ so@@ red and un@@ covered .
Some people say I &apos;m the first stand@@ -up com@@ ic in the Arab world .
I never like to claim first , but I do know that they never heard that n@@ as@@ ty little ru@@ mor that women aren &apos;t funny , and they find us hy@@ ster@@ ical .
In 2003 , my brother from another mother and father De@@ an O@@ be@@ id@@ all@@ ah and I started the New York Arab@@ -@@ American Com@@ e@@ dy F@@ es@@ tiv@@ al , now in its 10@@ th year .
Our goal was to change the negative image of Arab@@ -@@ Americans in media , while also re@@ min@@ ding cas@@ ting direc@@ tors that South A@@ sian and Arab are not syn@@ ony@@ m@@ ous .
M@@ ain@@ stre@@ aming Arab@@ s was much , much easier than con@@ qu@@ ering the challenge against the sti@@ g@@ ma against dis@@ ability .
My big break came in 2010 .
I was invited to be a gu@@ est on the c@@ able news show &quot; C@@ ount@@ down with Ke@@ ith O@@ l@@ ber@@ man@@ n . &quot;
I walked in looking like I was going to the pro@@ m , and they shu@@ ff@@ le me into a studio and seat me on a sp@@ inning , rol@@ ling chair .
So I looked at the stage man@@ ager and I &apos;m like , &quot; Ex@@ cu@@ se me , can I have another chair ? &quot;
And she looked at me and she went , &quot; F@@ ive , four , three , two ... &quot;
And we were live , right ?
So I had to gri@@ p onto the an@@ ch@@ or &apos;s des@@ k so that I wouldn &apos;t roll off the screen during the se@@ gment , and when the interview was over , I was li@@ vi@@ d .
I had finally gotten my chance and I ble@@ w it , and I knew I would never get invited back .
But not only did Mr. O@@ l@@ ber@@ man@@ n invite me back , he made me a ful@@ l@@ -@@ time contribu@@ tor , and he tap@@ ed down my chair .
One fun fact I learned while on the air with Ke@@ ith O@@ l@@ ber@@ man@@ n was that humans on the Internet are s@@ cu@@ m@@ b@@ ags .
People say children are cru@@ el , but I was never made fun of as a child or an adult .
Su@@ dd@@ enly , my dis@@ ability on the world wide web is fair game .
I would look at cli@@ ps online and see comm@@ ents like , &quot; Y@@ o , why &apos;s she tw@@ ea@@ kin &apos; ? &quot;
&quot; Y@@ o , is she ret@@ ar@@ ded ? &quot;
And my favorite , &quot; Po@@ or G@@ um@@ b@@ y-@@ mouth terror@@ ist .
What does she suff@@ er from ?
We should really pr@@ ay for her . &quot;
One comm@@ enter even sugges@@ ted that I add my dis@@ ability to my cre@@ d@@ its : scre@@ en@@ writer , com@@ e@@ di@@ an , pal@@ s@@ y .
Dis@@ ability is as visual as race .
If a whe@@ el@@ chair user can &apos;t play B@@ ey@@ on@@ c@@ é , then B@@ ey@@ on@@ c@@ é can &apos;t play a whe@@ el@@ chair user .
The dis@@ ab@@ led are the largest — Yeah , cl@@ ap for that , man . Come on .
People with dis@@ abilities are the largest min@@ ority in the world , and we are the most under@@ repres@@ ented in entert@@ ain@@ ment .
The doctors said that I wouldn &apos;t walk , but I am here in front of you .
However , if I grew up with social media , I don &apos;t think I would be .
I hope that together , we can create more positive images of dis@@ ability in the media and in everyday life .
Per@@ haps if there were more positive images , it would fo@@ ster less hate on the Internet .
Or maybe not .
Maybe it still takes a village to teach our children well .
My cro@@ o@@ ked journey has taken me to some very spectac@@ ular places .
I got to walk the red car@@ p@@ et fl@@ an@@ ked by so@@ ap di@@ va S@@ us@@ an Lu@@ c@@ ci and the i@@ con@@ ic Lo@@ re@@ en Ar@@ bus .
I got to act in a movie with Adam S@@ and@@ ler and work with my i@@ do@@ l , the amazing D@@ ave Mat@@ the@@ ws .
I tou@@ red the world as a head@@ lin@@ er on Arab@@ s G@@ one Wil@@ d .
I was a del@@ eg@@ ate repres@@ enting the great state of New Jer@@ sey at the 2008 D@@ N@@ C .
And I f@@ ounded May@@ soon &apos;s K@@ ids , a char@@ ity that hop@@ es to give Palest@@ in@@ ian refuge@@ e children a sli@@ ver of the chance my parents gave me .
But the one moment that st@@ ands out the most was when I got -- before this moment -- But the one moment that st@@ ands out the most was when I got to perform for the man who flo@@ ats like a but@@ ter@@ fly and st@@ ings like a be@@ e , has Par@@ kin@@ son &apos;s and sh@@ akes just like me , Mu@@ ham@@ ma@@ d Al@@ i .
It was the only time that my father ever saw me perform live , and I de@@ dic@@ ate this talk to his memory .
My name is May@@ soon Z@@ ay@@ id , and if I can can , you can can .
I would like to talk to you about a story about a small town kid .
I don &apos;t know his name , but I do know his story .
He lives in a small village in sou@@ thern Som@@ ali@@ a .
His village is near Mo@@ ga@@ dis@@ h@@ u .
D@@ rou@@ ght drives the small village into poverty and to the br@@ ink of star@@ vation .
With nothing left for him there , he leaves for the big city , in this case , Mo@@ ga@@ dis@@ h@@ u , the capital of Som@@ ali@@ a .
When he arri@@ ves , there are no opportunities , no jobs , no way forward .
He ends up living in a tent city on the out@@ sk@@ ir@@ ts of Mo@@ ga@@ dis@@ h@@ u .
Maybe a year pas@@ ses , nothing .
One day , he &apos;s appro@@ ach@@ ed by a gentlem@@ an who off@@ ers to take him to lunch , then to dinner , to break@@ fast .
He me@@ ets this dynamic group of people , and they give him a break .
He &apos;s given a bit of money to buy himself some new clo@@ thes , money to send back home to his family .
He is introduced to this young woman .
He eventually gets married .
He starts this new life .
He has a purpose in life .
One beautiful day in Mo@@ ga@@ dis@@ h@@ u , under an az@@ ure blue sky , a car bom@@ b goes off .
That small town kid with the big city dreams was the suicide bomb@@ er , and that dynamic group of people were al S@@ hab@@ a@@ ab , a terror@@ ist organization lin@@ ked to al Q@@ a@@ ed@@ a .
So how does the story of a small town kid just trying to make it big in the city end up with him blo@@ wing himself up ?
He was waiting .
He was waiting for an opportunity , waiting to begin his future , waiting for a way forward , and this was the first thing that came along .
This was the first thing that pul@@ led him out of what we call wai@@ th@@ ood .
And his story repe@@ ats itself in urban centers around the world .
It is the story of the dis@@ en@@ fran@@ ch@@ is@@ ed , un@@ employ@@ ed urban y@@ ou@@ th who s@@ par@@ ks ri@@ ots in Joh@@ ann@@ es@@ bur@@ g , s@@ par@@ ks ri@@ ots in London , who re@@ aches out for something other than wai@@ th@@ ood .
For young people , the promise of the city , the big city dream is that of opportunity , of jobs , of wealth , but young people are not sharing in the pro@@ sper@@ ity of their cities .
O@@ f@@ ten it &apos;s y@@ ou@@ th who suff@@ er from the highest un@@ employ@@ ment rates .
By 20@@ 30 , three out of five people living in cities will be under the age of 18 .
If we do not include young people in the growth of our cities , if we do not provide them opportunities , the story of wai@@ th@@ ood , the g@@ at@@ e@@ way to terrorism , to violence , to g@@ ang@@ s , will be the story of cities 2.@@ 0 .
And in my city of birth , Mo@@ ga@@ dis@@ h@@ u , 70 percent of young people suff@@ er from un@@ employ@@ ment .
70 percent don &apos;t work , don &apos;t go to school .
They pretty much do nothing .
I went back to Mo@@ ga@@ dis@@ h@@ u last month , and I went to visit Mad@@ ina Ho@@ sp@@ ital , the hospital I was born in .
I remember standing in front of that bul@@ let@@ -@@ ri@@ dden hospital thinking , what if I had never left ?
What if I had been forced into that same state of wai@@ th@@ ood ?
Would I have become a terror@@ ist ?
I &apos;m not really sure about the answer .
My reason for being in Mo@@ ga@@ dis@@ h@@ u that month was actually to ho@@ st a y@@ ou@@ th leadership and entrepren@@ eur@@ ship sum@@ mit .
I brought together about 90 young Som@@ al@@ i leaders .
We sat down and br@@ ain@@ st@@ orm@@ ed on solutions to the biggest challenges facing their city .
One of the young men in the room was A@@ den .
He went to university in Mo@@ ga@@ dis@@ h@@ u , gradu@@ ated .
There were no jobs , no opportunities .
I remember him telling me , because he was a college graduate , un@@ employ@@ ed , frustr@@ ated , that he was the perfect target for al S@@ hab@@ a@@ ab and other terror@@ ist organizations , to be recru@@ ited .
They sou@@ ght people like him out .
But his story takes a different route .
In Mo@@ ga@@ dis@@ h@@ u , the biggest barri@@ er to getting from point A to point B are the ro@@ ads .
Tw@@ ent@@ y-@@ three years of civil war have completely destro@@ yed the road system , and a mot@@ or@@ bi@@ ke can be the eas@@ i@@ est way to get around .
A@@ den saw an opportunity and se@@ ized it .
He started a mot@@ or@@ bi@@ ke company .
He began r@@ enting out mot@@ or@@ bi@@ kes to local res@@ id@@ ents who couldn &apos;t normally afford them .
He bought 10 bi@@ kes , with the help of family and friends , and his dream is to eventually exp@@ and to several hundred within the next three years .
How is this story different ?
What makes his story different ?
I believe it is his ability to identify and se@@ ize a new opportunity .
It &apos;s entrepren@@ eur@@ ship , and I believe entrepren@@ eur@@ ship can be the most powerful tool against wai@@ th@@ ood .
It em@@ po@@ wers young people to be the cre@@ ators of the very economic opportunities they are so des@@ per@@ ately see@@ king .
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs .
I want to talk to you about a young man who attend@@ ed one of my me@@ et@@ ings , Mo@@ ham@@ ed Mo@@ ham@@ oud , a fl@@ or@@ ist .
He was helping me train some of the young people at the sum@@ mit in entrepren@@ eur@@ ship and how to be innov@@ ative and how to create a culture of entrepren@@ eur@@ ship .
He &apos;s actually the first fl@@ or@@ ist Mo@@ ga@@ dis@@ h@@ u has seen in over 22 years , and until recently , until Mo@@ ham@@ ed came along , if you wanted f@@ lowers at your we@@ d@@ ding , you used plastic bou@@ qu@@ ets shi@@ pped from ab@@ road .
If you asked someone , &quot; When was the last time you saw fresh f@@ lowers ? &quot;
for many who grew up under civil war , the answer would be , &quot; N@@ ever . &quot;
So Mo@@ ham@@ ed saw an opportunity .
He started a lands@@ cap@@ ing and design fl@@ oral company .
He created a farm right outside of Mo@@ ga@@ dis@@ h@@ u , and started growing tu@@ li@@ ps and li@@ lies , which he said could survive the har@@ s@@ h Mo@@ ga@@ dis@@ h@@ u climate .
And he began deli@@ vering f@@ lowers to we@@ d@@ dings , creating gard@@ ens at homes and businesses around the city , and he &apos;s now working on creating Mo@@ ga@@ dis@@ h@@ u &apos;s first public park in 22 years .
There &apos;s no public park in Mo@@ ga@@ dis@@ h@@ u .
He wants to create a space where families , young people , can come together , and , as he says , smell the pro@@ ver@@ bi@@ al ro@@ ses .
And he doesn &apos;t grow ro@@ ses because they use too much water , by the way .
So the first step is to inspire young people , and in that room , Mo@@ ham@@ ed &apos;s pres@@ ence had a really profound impact on the y@@ ou@@ th in that room .
They had never really thought about starting up a business .
They &apos;ve thought about working for an N@@ G@@ O , working for the government , but his story , his innovation , really had a strong impact on them .
He forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity .
He em@@ powered them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs , that they could be change ma@@ kers .
By the end of the day , they were coming up with innov@@ ative solutions to some of the biggest challenges facing their city .
They came up with entrepren@@ eu@@ ri@@ al solutions to local problems .
So inspir@@ ing young people and creating a culture of entrepren@@ eur@@ ship is a really great step , but young people need capital to make their ideas a reality .
They need exper@@ tise and ment@@ or@@ ship to guide them in developing and laun@@ ching their businesses .
C@@ onn@@ ect young people with the resources they need , provide them the support they need to go from ide@@ ation to creation , and you will create cat@@ aly@@ sts for urban growth .
For me , entrepren@@ eur@@ ship is more than just starting up a business .
It &apos;s about creating a social impact .
Mo@@ ham@@ ed is not simply selling f@@ lowers .
I believe he is selling hope .
His P@@ ea@@ ce Park , and that &apos;s what he calls it , when it &apos;s created , will actually transform the way people see their city .
A@@ den hi@@ red street kids to help rent out and ma@@ intain those bi@@ kes for him .
He gave them the opportunity to es@@ cape the paraly@@ sis of wai@@ th@@ ood .
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact in their cities .
So my sugges@@ tion is , turn y@@ ou@@ th into entrepreneurs , in@@ cu@@ b@@ ate and nur@@ ture their inher@@ ent innovation , and you will have more stories of f@@ lowers and P@@ ea@@ ce Par@@ ks than of car bomb@@ s and wai@@ th@@ ood .
Thank you .
I was about 10 years old on a cam@@ ping trip with my dad in the A@@ dir@@ ond@@ ack M@@ ount@@ ains , a wil@@ der@@ ness area in the nor@@ thern part of New York State .
It was a beautiful day .
The forest was s@@ par@@ k@@ ling .
The sun made the leaves g@@ low like st@@ ained glass , and if it weren &apos;t for the path we were following , we could almost pre@@ tend we were the first human beings to ever walk that land .
We got to our camp@@ site .
It was a le@@ an@@ -@@ to on a blu@@ ff looking over a cry@@ st@@ al , beautiful la@@ ke , when I discovered a hor@@ ror .
Be@@ h@@ ind the le@@ an@@ -@@ to was a du@@ mp , maybe 40 feet square with rot@@ ting app@@ le cor@@ es and bal@@ le@@ d-@@ up alu@@ minu@@ m fo@@ il , and a dead sn@@ ea@@ ker .
And I was as@@ ton@@ ished , I was very an@@ gry , and I was deeply conf@@ used .
The cam@@ pers who were too la@@ z@@ y to take out what they had brought in , who did they think would clean up after them ?
That question st@@ ayed with me , and it simpli@@ fied a little .
Who cle@@ ans up after us ?
However you con@@ figure or wh@@ er@@ ever you place the us , who cle@@ ans up after us in I@@ st@@ an@@ bu@@ l ?
Who cle@@ ans up after us in Rio or in Paris or in London ?
Here in New York , the De@@ partment of San@@ itation cle@@ ans up after us , to the tune of 1@@ 1,000 tons of gar@@ bage and 2,000 tons of recycl@@ ables every day .
I wanted to get to know them as individuals .
I wanted to understand who takes the job .
What &apos;s it like to wear the uni@@ form and bear that bur@@ den ?
So I started a research project with them .
I ro@@ de in the truc@@ ks and walked the routes and intervie@@ wed people in off@@ ices and fac@@ ilities all over the city , and I learned a lot , but I was still an out@@ si@@ der .
I needed to go deeper .
So I took the job as a san@@ itation wor@@ ker .
I didn &apos;t just ride in the truc@@ ks now . I dro@@ ve the truc@@ ks .
And I oper@@ ated the mechan@@ ical bro@@ oms and I pl@@ ow@@ ed the s@@ now .
It was a remarkable privil@@ e@@ ge and an amazing education .
Every@@ one asks about the smell .
It &apos;s there , but it &apos;s not as pre@@ val@@ ent as you think , and on days when it is really bad , you get used to it rather quickly .
The weight takes a long time to get used to .
I knew people who were several years on the job whose bodies were still ad@@ just@@ ing to the bur@@ den of be@@ ar@@ ing on your body tons of tr@@ ash every week .
Then there &apos;s the danger .
Ac@@ cor@@ ding to the Bu@@ re@@ au of L@@ ab@@ or St@@ atis@@ tics , san@@ itation work is one of the 10 most dangerous occup@@ ations in the country , and I learned why .
You &apos;re in and out of traffic all day , and it &apos;s zo@@ om@@ ing around you .
It just wants to get past you , so it &apos;s often the mot@@ or@@ ist is not paying attention .
That &apos;s really bad for the wor@@ ker .
And then the gar@@ bage itself is full of h@@ az@@ ards that often fly back out of the truc@@ k and do terrible har@@ m .
I also learned about the rel@@ ent@@ less@@ ness of tr@@ ash .
When you step off the cur@@ b and you see a city from behind a truc@@ k , you come to understand that tr@@ ash is like a force of nature un@@ to itself .
It never stop@@ s coming .
It &apos;s also like a form of respir@@ ation or circulation .
It must always be in motion .
And then there &apos;s the sti@@ g@@ ma .
You put on the uni@@ form , and you become invisible until someone is up@@ set with you for whatever reason like you &apos;ve bloc@@ ked traffic with your truc@@ k , or you &apos;re taking a break too close to their home , or you &apos;re dr@@ inking coffee in their din@@ er , and they will come and s@@ cor@@ n you , and tell you that they don &apos;t want you anywhere near them .
I find the sti@@ g@@ ma especially iron@@ ic , because I strong@@ ly believe that san@@ itation workers are the most important labor force on the streets of the city , for three reasons .
They are the first gu@@ ar@@ di@@ ans of public health .
If they &apos;re not taking away tr@@ ash effici@@ ently and effectively every day , it starts to sp@@ ill out of its cont@@ ain@@ ments , and the d@@ angers inher@@ ent to it threat@@ en us in very real ways .
Dis@@ eas@@ es we &apos;ve had in check for decades and centu@@ ries bur@@ st forth again and start to har@@ m us .
The economy needs them .
If we can &apos;t throw out the old stuff , we have no room for the new stuff , so then the eng@@ ines of the economy start to s@@ put@@ ter when consumption is com@@ prom@@ is@@ ed .
I &apos;m not ad@@ voc@@ ating capitalis@@ m , I &apos;m just poin@@ ting out their relationship .
And then there &apos;s what I call our average , necessary qu@@ o@@ ti@@ di@@ an vel@@ oc@@ ity .
By that I simply mean how fast we &apos;re used to moving in the contempor@@ ary day and age .
We usually don &apos;t care for , re@@ pair , clean , carry around our coffee cu@@ p , our sh@@ op@@ ping b@@ ag , our bot@@ tle of water .
We use them , we throw them out , we forget about them , because we know there &apos;s a work@@ force on the other side that &apos;s going to take it all away .
So I want to suggest today a couple of ways to think about san@@ itation that will perhaps help am@@ eli@@ or@@ ate the sti@@ g@@ ma and bring them into this conversation of how to craft a city that is sustainable and human@@ e .
Their work , I think , is kind of lit@@ ur@@ g@@ ical .
They &apos;re on the streets every day , rhy@@ th@@ m@@ ically .
They wear a uni@@ form in many cities .
You know when to expect them .
And their work lets us do our work .
They are almost a form of reas@@ sur@@ ance .
The flow that they ma@@ intain kee@@ ps us safe from ourselves , from our own dro@@ ss , our cas@@ t-@@ off@@ s , and that flow must be ma@@ int@@ ained always no matter what .
On the day after Sep@@ t@@ ember 11 in 2001 , I heard the grow@@ l of a san@@ itation truc@@ k on the street , and I gr@@ ab@@ bed my inf@@ ant son and I ran down@@ st@@ airs and there was a man doing his paper recycl@@ ing route like he did every W@@ ed@@ n@@ es@@ day .
And I tried to thank him for doing his work on that day of all days , but I started to cr@@ y .
And he looked at me , and he just no@@ d@@ ded , and he said , &quot; We &apos;re going to be okay .
We &apos;re going to be okay . &quot;
It was a little while later that I started my research with san@@ itation , and I met that man again .
His name is Pau@@ lie , and we worked together many times , and we became good friends .
I want to believe that Pau@@ lie was right .
We are going to be okay .
But in our effort to re@@ con@@ figure how we as a species exist on this planet , we must include and take account of all the costs , including the very real human cost of the labor .
And we also would be well inform@@ ed to reach out to the people who do that work and get their exper@@ tise on how do we think about , how do we create systems around sustain@@ ability that perhaps take us from cur@@ b@@ side recycl@@ ing , which is a remarkable success across 40 years , across the United States and countries around the world , and li@@ ft us up to a broad@@ er horiz@@ on
where we &apos;re looking at other forms of waste from manufactu@@ ring and industrial sources .
M@@ un@@ ici@@ p@@ al waste , what we think of when we talk about gar@@ bage , accoun@@ ts for three percent of the nation &apos;s waste stream .
It &apos;s a remarkable stati@@ stic .
So in the flow of your days , in the flow of your lives , next time you see someone whose job is to clean up after you , take a moment to ac@@ knowledge them .
Take a moment to say thank you .
My work foc@@ uses on the connection of both thinking about our community life being part of the environment where architecture gro@@ ws from the natural local conditions and traditions .
Today I brought two recent projects as an example of this .
B@@ oth projects are in emerging countries , one in Ethiop@@ ia and another one in T@@ un@@ is@@ ia .
And also they have in common that the different analy@@ ses from different perspec@@ tives becomes an essential part of the final piece of architecture .
The first example started with an inv@@ itation to design a multi@@ story sh@@ op@@ ping m@@ all in Ethiop@@ ia &apos;s capital city A@@ dd@@ is A@@ bab@@ a .
And this is the type of building we were shown as an example , to my team and myself , of what we had to design .
At first , the first thing I thought was , I want to run away .
After seeing a few of these buildings -- there are many in the city -- we realized that they have three very big points .
First , these buildings , they are almost empty because they have very large sh@@ ops where people cannot afford to buy things .
Second , they need tons of energy to perform because of the skin treatment with glass that creates heat in the inside , and then you need a lot of co@@ ol@@ ing .
In a city where this shouldn &apos;t happen because they have really mil@@ d weather that rang@@ es from 20 to 25 degrees the whole year .
And third is that their image has nothing to do with Africa and with Ethiop@@ ia .
It is a p@@ ity in a place that has such rich culture and traditions .
Al@@ so during our first visit to Ethiop@@ ia , I was really cap@@ tiv@@ ated by the old mer@@ k@@ a@@ to that is this open-@@ air structure where thousands of people , they go and buy things every day from small vend@@ ors .
And also it has this idea of the public space that uses the out@@ do@@ ors to create activity .
So I thought , this is what I really want to design , not a sh@@ op@@ ping m@@ all .
But the question was how we could do a multi@@ story , contempor@@ ary building with these principles .
The next challenge was when we looked at the site , that is , in a really growing area of the city , where most of these buildings that you see in the image , they were not there .
And it &apos;s also between two par@@ alle@@ l streets that don &apos;t have any connection for hundreds of meters .
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets , putting all the entr@@ ances of the building .
And this ext@@ ends with an in@@ clin@@ ed atri@@ um that creates an open-@@ air space in the building that self-@@ prot@@ ects itself with its own shape from the sun and the rain .
And around this vo@@ id we placed this idea of the market with small sh@@ ops , that change in each floor because of the shape of the vo@@ id .
I also thought , how to close the building ?
And I really wanted to find a solution that would respond to the local climate conditions .
And I started thinking about the tex@@ tile like a sh@@ ell made of concre@@ te with per@@ for@@ ations that would let the air in , and also the light , but in a fil@@ tered way .
And then the inspiration came from these beautiful patterns of the Ethiop@@ ian women &apos;s dr@@ esses .
That they have fr@@ act@@ al ge@@ om@@ etry properties and this helped me to shape the whole fac@@ ade .
And we are building that with these small pre@@ fabric@@ ated pieces that are the windo@@ ws that let the air and the light in a controlled way inside the building .
And this is compl@@ ement@@ ed by these small colo@@ red gl@@ asses that use the light from the inside of the building to light up the building at night .
With these ideas it was not easy first to convince the develop@@ ers because they were like , &quot; This is not a sh@@ op@@ ping m@@ all . We didn &apos;t ask for that . &quot;
But then we all realized that this idea of the market happened to be a lot more prof@@ itable than the idea of the sh@@ op@@ ping m@@ all because basically they had more sh@@ ops to sell .
And also that the idea of the fac@@ ade was much , much che@@ aper , not only because of the material compared with the glass , but also because we didn &apos;t need to have air condi@@ tioning anymore .
So we created some budget sav@@ ings that we used to impl@@ ement the project .
And the first impl@@ ement@@ ation was to think about how we could make the building self-@@ suff@@ ici@@ ent in terms of energy in a city that has electricity cu@@ ts almost every day .
So we created a huge ass@@ et by plac@@ ing photo@@ vol@@ t@@ ai@@ cs there on the ro@@ of .
And then under those pan@@ els we thought about the ro@@ of like a new public space with gath@@ ering areas and b@@ ars that would create this urban o@@ as@@ is .
And these por@@ ches on the ro@@ of , all together they collect the water to reuse for san@@ itation on the inside .
H@@ op@@ efully by the beginning of next year , because we are already on the fi@@ f@@ th floor of the construction .
The second example is a master plan of 2,000 ap@@ art@@ ments and fac@@ ilities in the city of T@@ un@@ is .
And for doing such a big project , the biggest project I &apos;ve ever designed , I really needed to understand the city of T@@ un@@ is , but also its surr@@ oun@@ dings and the tradition and culture .
Dur@@ ing that analysis I paid special attention to the me@@ din@@ a that is this 1,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ year-old structure that used to be closed by a wall , opened by tw@@ el@@ ve different g@@ ates , connected by almost straight lines .
When I went to the site , the first design operation we did was to ex@@ tend the existing streets , creating 12 initi@@ al blocks similar in size and character@@ is@@ tics to the ones we have in Bar@@ cel@@ on@@ a and other cities in Europe with these cour@@ ty@@ ards .
On top of that , we sel@@ ected some strate@@ gi@@ c points re@@ min@@ ded of this idea of the g@@ ates and connec@@ ting them by straight lines , and this modi@@ fied this initi@@ al pattern .
And the last operation was to think about the cell , the small cell of the project , like the ap@@ art@@ ment , as an essential part of the master plan .
And for that I thought , what would be the best ori@@ entation in the M@@ ed@@ iter@@ ran@@ e@@ an climate for an ap@@ art@@ ment ?
And it &apos;s nor@@ th-@@ south , because it creates a ther@@ mal difference between both sides of the house and then a natural venti@@ lation .
So we over@@ la@@ p a pattern that makes sure that most of the ap@@ art@@ ments are perfectly ori@@ ented in that direction .
And this is the result that is almost like a combin@@ ation of the European block and the Arab city .
It has these blocks with cour@@ ty@@ ards , and then on the ground floor you have all these connections for the pe@@ des@@ tri@@ ans .
And also it respon@@ ds to the local regul@@ ations that establ@@ ish a higher den@@ sity on the up@@ per levels and a lower den@@ sity on the ground floor .
And it also re@@ in@@ forces this idea of the g@@ ates .
The volume has this connec@@ ting shape that sh@@ ades itself with three different types of ap@@ art@@ ments and also lets the light go on the ground floor in a very dense neighborhood And in the cour@@ ty@@ ards there are the different fac@@ ilities , such as a gy@@ m and a kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten and close by , a series of commercial &#91; spaces &#93; that bring activity to the ground floor .
The ro@@ of , which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving back to the community the space taken by the construction .
And it &apos;s where all the neighb@@ ors , they can go up and soci@@ alize , and do acti@@ vi@@ ties such as having a two-@@ kilom@@ eter run in the morning , ju@@ mp@@ ing from one building to another .
These two examples , they have a common approach in the design process .
And also , they are in emerging countries where you can see the cities literally growing .
In these cities , the impact of architecture in people &apos;s lives of today and tomorrow changes the local communities and econom@@ ies at the same speed as the buildings grow .
For this reason , I see even more importance to look at architecture finding simple but aff@@ ord@@ able solutions that en@@ h@@ ance the relationship between the community and the environment and that ai@@ m to connect nature and people .
Thank you very much .
So when I was eight years old , a new girl came to join the class , and she was so impres@@ sive , as the new girl always seems to be .
She had vast quanti@@ ties of very sh@@ in@@ y hair and a cu@@ te little pen@@ c@@ il case , super strong on state capit@@ als , just a great sp@@ el@@ ler .
And I just cur@@ d@@ led with je@@ al@@ ous@@ y that year , until I h@@ at@@ ched my devi@@ ous plan .
So one day I st@@ ayed a little late after school , a little too late , and I lu@@ r@@ ked in the girls &apos; b@@ ath@@ room .
When the coast was clear , I emerg@@ ed , cre@@ pt into the classroom , and took from my teacher &apos;s des@@ k the grade book .
And then I did it .
I fi@@ dd@@ led with my riv@@ al &apos;s gr@@ ades , just a little , just dem@@ ot@@ ed some of those A &apos;s .
All of those A &apos;s . And I got ready to return the book to the dra@@ wer , when han@@ g on , some of my other class@@ mates had app@@ all@@ ingly good gr@@ ades too .
So , in a fr@@ enz@@ y , I correc@@ ted everybody &apos;s mar@@ ks , not imagin@@ atively .
I gave everybody a row of D &apos;s and I gave myself a row of A &apos;s , just because I was there , you know , might as well .
And I am still b@@ aff@@ led by my behavior .
I don &apos;t understand where the idea came from .
I don &apos;t understand why I felt so great doing it .
I felt great .
I don &apos;t understand why I was never caught .
I mean , it should have been so bl@@ at@@ antly obvious .
I was never caught .
But most of all , I am b@@ aff@@ led by , why did it bo@@ ther me so much that this little girl , this tiny little girl , was so good at sp@@ elling ?
Je@@ al@@ ous@@ y b@@ aff@@ les me .
It &apos;s so myst@@ er@@ ious , and it &apos;s so per@@ vas@@ ive .
We know babies suff@@ er from je@@ al@@ ous@@ y .
We know prim@@ ates do . B@@ lu@@ e@@ birds are actually very pr@@ one .
We know that je@@ al@@ ous@@ y is the number one cause of s@@ pou@@ s@@ al mur@@ der in the United States .
And yet , I have never read a study that can par@@ se to me its lon@@ el@@ iness or its long@@ ev@@ ity or its gri@@ m thr@@ ill .
For that , we have to go to fiction , because the nov@@ el is the lab that has studied je@@ al@@ ous@@ y in every possible con@@ figur@@ ation .
In fact , I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s an exag@@ ger@@ ation to say that if we didn &apos;t have je@@ al@@ ous@@ y , would we even have liter@@ ature ?
Well no fai@@ th@@ less Hel@@ en , no &quot; O@@ dy@@ s@@ sey . &quot;
No je@@ al@@ ous king , no &quot; Arab@@ ian Ni@@ ghts . &quot;
No Sh@@ ak@@ esp@@ ea@@ re .
There goes high school reading l@@ ists , because we &apos;re losing &quot; S@@ ound and the F@@ ury , &quot; we &apos;re losing &quot; G@@ at@@ s@@ by , &quot; &quot; Sun Al@@ so R@@ ises , &quot; we &apos;re losing &quot; Mad@@ ame Bo@@ v@@ ary , &quot; &quot; An@@ na K. &quot;
No je@@ al@@ ous@@ y , no P@@ rou@@ st . And now , I mean , I know it &apos;s fashi@@ on@@ able to say that P@@ rou@@ st has the answers to everything , but in the case of je@@ al@@ ous@@ y , he kind of does .
This year is the cent@@ enni@@ al of his mas@@ ter@@ piece , &quot; In S@@ ear@@ ch of Lo@@ st Ti@@ me , &quot; and it &apos;s the most ex@@ h@@ aus@@ tive study of sexual je@@ al@@ ous@@ y and just regular competi@@ ti@@ ven@@ ess , my brand , that we can hope to have . And we think about P@@ rou@@ st , we think about the senti@@ mental bits , right ?
We think about a little boy trying to get to sleep .
We think about a ma@@ del@@ e@@ ine mo@@ is@@ ten@@ ed in lav@@ ender te@@ a .
We forget how har@@ s@@ h his vision was .
We forget how pi@@ til@@ ess he is .
I mean , these are books that Vir@@ gin@@ ia W@@ o@@ ol@@ f said were tough as cat g@@ ut .
I don &apos;t know what cat g@@ ut is , but let &apos;s assu@@ me it &apos;s for@@ mid@@ able .
Let &apos;s look at why they go so well together , the nov@@ el and je@@ al@@ ous@@ y , je@@ al@@ ous@@ y and P@@ rou@@ st .
Is it something as obvious as that je@@ al@@ ous@@ y , which bo@@ ils down into person , desire , im@@ pe@@ di@@ ment , is such a soli@@ d narrative foundation ?
I don &apos;t know . I think it cu@@ ts very close to the bone , because let &apos;s think about what happens when we feel je@@ al@@ ous .
When we feel je@@ al@@ ous , we tell ourselves a story .
We tell ourselves a story about other people &apos;s lives , and these stories make us feel terrible because they &apos;re designed to make us feel terrible .
As the tel@@ ler of the tale and the audience , we know just what details to include , to di@@ g that k@@ ni@@ fe in . Right ?
Je@@ al@@ ous@@ y makes us all am@@ ateur nov@@ el@@ ists , and this is something P@@ rou@@ st understood .
In the first volume , S@@ wan@@ n &apos;s W@@ ay , the series of books , S@@ wan@@ n , one of the main characters , is thinking very fon@@ dly of his mis@@ tr@@ ess and how great she is in bed , and suddenly , in the course of a few sent@@ ences , and these are P@@ rou@@ sti@@ an sent@@ ences , so they &apos;re long as ri@@ vers , but in the course of a few sent@@ ences , he suddenly reco@@ ils and he realiz@@ es , &quot; H@@ ang on , everything I love about this woman ,
somebody else would love about this woman .
Everything that she does that gives me plea@@ sure could be giving somebody else plea@@ sure , maybe right about now . &quot;
And this is the story he starts to tell himself , and from then on , P@@ rou@@ st wr@@ ites that every fresh char@@ m S@@ wan@@ n det@@ ects in his mis@@ tr@@ ess , he ad@@ ds to his &quot; collection of instruments in his private tor@@ ture cham@@ ber . &quot;
Now S@@ wan@@ n and P@@ rou@@ st , we have to ad@@ mit , were not@@ ori@@ ously je@@ al@@ ous .
You know , P@@ rou@@ st &apos;s bo@@ y@@ friends would have to leave the country if they wanted to break up with him .
But you don &apos;t have to be that je@@ al@@ ous to con@@ ce@@ de that it &apos;s hard work . Right ?
Je@@ al@@ ous@@ y is ex@@ hau@@ sting .
It &apos;s a hun@@ gry emotion . It must be f@@ ed .
And what does je@@ al@@ ous@@ y like ?
Je@@ al@@ ous@@ y li@@ kes information .
Je@@ al@@ ous@@ y li@@ kes details .
Je@@ al@@ ous@@ y li@@ kes the vast quanti@@ ties of sh@@ in@@ y hair , the cu@@ te little pen@@ c@@ il case .
Je@@ al@@ ous@@ y li@@ kes photos .
That &apos;s why Inst@@ ag@@ ram is such a hit . P@@ rou@@ st actually lin@@ ks the language of sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ ship and je@@ al@@ ous@@ y .
When S@@ wan@@ n is in his je@@ al@@ ous thro@@ es , and suddenly he &apos;s listening at do@@ or@@ ways and bri@@ bing his mis@@ tr@@ ess &apos; serv@@ ants , he def@@ ends these behavi@@ ors .
He says , &quot; You know , look , I know you think this is re@@ pu@@ gn@@ ant , but it is no different from inter@@ pre@@ ting an ancient text or looking at a mon@@ u@@ ment . &quot;
He says , &quot; They are scientific investig@@ ations with real intellectu@@ al value . &quot;
P@@ rou@@ st is trying to show us that je@@ al@@ ous@@ y feels int@@ ol@@ er@@ able and makes us look ab@@ sur@@ d , but it is , at its cru@@ x , a qu@@ est for knowledge , a qu@@ est for truth , pain@@ ful truth , and actually , where P@@ rou@@ st is concerned , the more pain@@ ful the truth , the better .
G@@ ri@@ ef , humi@@ li@@ ation , loss : These were the aven@@ ues to wisdom for P@@ rou@@ st .
He says , &quot; A woman whom we need , who makes us suff@@ er , el@@ ic@@ its from us a gam@@ ut of feelings far more profound and v@@ ital than a man of gen@@ i@@ us who interes@@ ts us . &quot;
Is he telling us to just go and find cru@@ el women ?
No . I think he &apos;s trying to say that je@@ al@@ ous@@ y reve@@ als us to ourselves .
And does any other emotion cr@@ ack us open in this particular way ?
Does any other emotion reve@@ al to us our ag@@ gr@@ ession and our hi@@ de@@ ous ambi@@ tion and our enti@@ t@@ lement ?
Does any other emotion teach us to look with such p@@ ecu@@ li@@ ar inten@@ sity ?
F@@ reu@@ d would write about this later .
One day , F@@ reu@@ d was vis@@ ited by this very anx@@ ious young man who was consum@@ ed with the thought of his wife che@@ ating on him .
And F@@ reu@@ d says , it &apos;s something strange about this guy , because he &apos;s not looking at what his wife is doing .
Because she &apos;s bl@@ am@@ eless ; everybody knows it .
The poor cre@@ ature is just under susp@@ ici@@ on for no cause .
But he &apos;s looking for things that his wife is doing without notic@@ ing , un@@ in@@ tenti@@ onal behavi@@ ors .
Is she sm@@ iling too bri@@ ghtly here , or did she ac@@ cident@@ ally br@@ ush up against a man there ?
&#91; F@@ reu@@ d &#93; says that the man is becoming the cu@@ sto@@ di@@ an of his wife &apos;s un@@ conscious .
The nov@@ el is very good on this point .
The nov@@ el is very good at descri@@ bing how je@@ al@@ ous@@ y tr@@ ains us to look with inten@@ sity but not accur@@ acy .
In fact , the more inten@@ sely je@@ al@@ ous we are , the more we become res@@ id@@ ents of fantas@@ y .
And this is why , I think , je@@ al@@ ous@@ y doesn &apos;t just provo@@ ke us to do violent things or il@@ legal things .
Je@@ al@@ ous@@ y prom@@ p@@ ts us to be@@ have in ways that are wil@@ dly inv@@ enti@@ ve .
Now I &apos;m thinking of myself at eight , I con@@ ce@@ de , but I &apos;m also thinking of this story I heard on the news .
A 5@@ 2@@ -year-old Mich@@ ig@@ an woman was caught creating a fa@@ ke Facebook account from which she sent vi@@ le , hi@@ de@@ ous messages to her@@ self for a year .
For a year . A year .
And she was trying to frame her ex@@ -@@ bo@@ y@@ friend &apos;s new gir@@ l@@ friend , and I have to conf@@ ess when I heard this , I just re@@ acted with ad@@ mir@@ ation .
Because , I mean , let &apos;s be real .
What immense , if mis@@ placed , creativity . Right ?
This is something from a nov@@ el .
This is something from a P@@ atr@@ ici@@ a H@@ igh@@ sm@@ ith nov@@ el .
Now H@@ igh@@ sm@@ ith is a particular favorite of mine .
She is the very brilliant and bizarre woman of American letters .
She &apos;s the auth@@ or of &quot; S@@ tr@@ angers on a T@@ rain &quot; and &quot; The T@@ al@@ ented Mr. Ri@@ pl@@ ey , &quot; books that are all about how je@@ al@@ ous@@ y , it mu@@ dd@@ les our minds , and once we &apos;re in the sphere , in that re@@ al@@ m of je@@ al@@ ous@@ y , the mem@@ br@@ ane between what is and what could be can be pi@@ er@@ c@@ ed in an instant .
Take Tom Ri@@ pl@@ ey , her most famous character .
Now , Tom Ri@@ pl@@ ey goes from wan@@ ting you or wan@@ ting what you have to being you and having what you once had , and you &apos;re under the flo@@ or@@ bo@@ ards , he &apos;s ans@@ wer@@ ing to your name , he &apos;s wearing your r@@ ings , emp@@ t@@ ying your bank account .
That &apos;s one way to go .
But what do we do ? We can &apos;t go the Tom Ri@@ pl@@ ey route .
I can &apos;t give the world D &apos;s , as much as I would really like to , some days .
And it &apos;s a p@@ ity , because we live in en@@ vi@@ ous times .
We live in je@@ al@@ ous times .
I mean , we &apos;re all good citizens of social media , aren &apos;t we , where the curr@@ ency is env@@ y ?
Does the nov@@ el show us a way out ? I &apos;m not sure .
So let &apos;s do what characters always do when they &apos;re not sure , when they are in poss@@ ession of a myst@@ ery .
Let &apos;s go to 2@@ 21@@ B B@@ ak@@ er Street and ask for S@@ her@@ lock H@@ ol@@ mes .
When people think of H@@ ol@@ mes , they think of his n@@ em@@ es@@ is being Pro@@ f@@ essor M@@ ori@@ ar@@ ty , right , this crimin@@ al mas@@ ter@@ mind .
But I &apos;ve always pre@@ fer@@ red &#91; In@@ spec@@ tor &#93; L@@ es@@ trade , who is the r@@ at@@ -@@ fac@@ ed head of Scot@@ land Y@@ ard who needs H@@ ol@@ mes des@@ per@@ ately , needs H@@ ol@@ mes &apos; gen@@ i@@ us , but res@@ ents him .
Oh , it &apos;s so familiar to me .
So L@@ es@@ trade needs his help , res@@ ents him , and sort of see@@ thes with bit@@ tern@@ ess over the course of the myst@@ eries .
But as they work together , something starts to change , and finally in &quot; The Ad@@ venture of the S@@ ix N@@ apo@@ le@@ ons , &quot; once H@@ ol@@ mes comes in , d@@ az@@ z@@ les everybody with his solution , L@@ es@@ trade turns to H@@ ol@@ mes and he says , &quot; We &apos;re not je@@ al@@ ous of you , Mr. H@@ ol@@ mes .
We &apos;re proud of you . &quot;
And he says that there &apos;s not a man at Scot@@ land Y@@ ard who wouldn &apos;t want to sh@@ ake S@@ her@@ lock H@@ ol@@ mes &apos; hand .
It &apos;s one of the few times we see H@@ ol@@ mes moved in the myst@@ eries , and I find it very moving , this little scene , but it &apos;s also myst@@ er@@ ious , right ?
It seems to treat je@@ al@@ ous@@ y as a problem of ge@@ om@@ etry , not emotion .
You know , one minute H@@ ol@@ mes is on the other side from L@@ es@@ trade .
The next minute they &apos;re on the same side .
Su@@ dd@@ enly , L@@ es@@ trade is l@@ etting himself ad@@ mi@@ re this mind that he &apos;s res@@ ented .
Could it be so simple though ?
What if je@@ al@@ ous@@ y really is a matter of ge@@ om@@ etry , just a matter of where we allow ourselves to stand in relation to another ?
Well , maybe then we wouldn &apos;t have to res@@ ent somebody &apos;s excell@@ ence .
We could al@@ ign ourselves with it .
But I like contin@@ gency plans .
So while we wait for that to happen , let us remember that we have fiction for con@@ sol@@ ation .
F@@ ic@@ tion alone dem@@ y@@ sti@@ fi@@ es je@@ al@@ ous@@ y .
F@@ ic@@ tion alone domes@@ tic@@ ates it , inv@@ ites it to the table .
And look who it gath@@ ers : swe@@ et L@@ es@@ trade , terri@@ fying Tom Ri@@ pl@@ ey , crazy S@@ wan@@ n , Mar@@ c@@ el P@@ rou@@ st himself .
We are in ex@@ cellent company .
Thank you .
So , we used to solve big problems .
On Ju@@ ly 21@@ st , 196@@ 9 , Bu@@ z@@ z Al@@ dr@@ in clim@@ bed out of A@@ poll@@ o 11 &apos;s lun@@ ar mo@@ du@@ le and desc@@ ended onto the Se@@ a of Tr@@ an@@ qu@@ il@@ ity .
Ar@@ m@@ strong and Al@@ dr@@ in were alone , but their pres@@ ence on the moon &apos;s gr@@ ay surface was the cul@@ min@@ ation of a conv@@ ul@@ sive , collective effort .
The A@@ poll@@ o program was the greatest pe@@ ace@@ time mobi@@ liz@@ ation in the history of the United States .
To get to the moon , NASA spent around 1@@ 80 billion dollars in today &apos;s money , or four percent of the fe@@ der@@ al budget .
A@@ poll@@ o employ@@ ed around 4@@ 00,000 people and demand@@ ed the collaboration of 20@@ ,000 companies , univer@@ si@@ ties and government ag@@ encies .
People died , including the cre@@ w of A@@ poll@@ o 1 .
But before the A@@ poll@@ o program ended , 24 men fle@@ w to the moon .
Tw@@ el@@ ve walked on its surface , of whom Al@@ dr@@ in , following the death of Ar@@ m@@ strong last year , is now the most sen@@ ior .
So why did they go ?
They didn &apos;t bring much back : 8@@ 4@@ 1 pounds of old ro@@ cks , and something all 24 later em@@ ph@@ as@@ ized -- a new sense of the small@@ ness and the frag@@ il@@ ity of our common home .
Why did they go ? The cy@@ n@@ ical answer is they went because President Ken@@ ne@@ dy wanted to show the So@@ vi@@ ets that his nation had the better ro@@ ck@@ ets .
But Ken@@ ne@@ dy &apos;s own words at R@@ ice University in 196@@ 2 provide a better c@@ lue .
John F@@ . Ken@@ ne@@ dy : But why , some say , the moon ?
Why choose this as our goal ?
And they may well ask , why clim@@ b the highest mountain ?
Why , 35 years ago , fly the Atlan@@ tic ?
Why does R@@ ice play Texas ?
We choose to go to the moon .
We choose to go to the moon .
We choose to go to the moon in this decade , and do the other things , not because they are easy , but because they are hard .
J@@ ason P@@ on@@ tin : To contempor@@ aries , A@@ poll@@ o wasn &apos;t only a vic@@ t@@ ory of West over East in the C@@ old War .
At the time , the strong@@ est emotion was of wonder at the trans@@ cend@@ ent po@@ wers of technology .
They went because it was a big thing to do .
L@@ anding on the moon occur@@ red in the context of a long series of techno@@ logical tri@@ um@@ ph@@ s .
The first half of the 20th century produced the ass@@ em@@ bly line and the airplane , pen@@ ic@@ illi@@ n and a vacc@@ ine for tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis .
In the middle years of the century , polio was er@@ a@@ dic@@ ated and small@@ po@@ x el@@ im@@ in@@ ated .
T@@ echno@@ logy itself seemed to poss@@ ess what Al@@ vin T@@ off@@ ler in 19@@ 70 called &quot; acceler@@ ative thr@@ ust . &quot;
For most of human history , we could go no faster than a hor@@ se or a boat with a s@@ ail , but in 196@@ 9 , the cre@@ w of A@@ poll@@ o 10 fle@@ w at 2@@ 5,000 miles an hour .
Since 19@@ 70 , no human beings have been back to the moon .
No one has trav@@ eled faster than the cre@@ w of A@@ poll@@ o 10 , and bli@@ the optimis@@ m about technology &apos;s po@@ wers has ev@@ a@@ por@@ ated as big problems we had imagin@@ ed technology would solve , such as going to Mars , creating clean energy , cur@@ ing cancer , or fe@@ eding the world have come to seem intr@@ act@@ ably hard .
I remember watching the lif@@ to@@ ff of A@@ poll@@ o 17 .
I was five years old , and my mother told me not to st@@ are at the fi@@ ery ex@@ hau@@ st of a Satur@@ n V ro@@ cket .
I vag@@ u@@ ely knew this was to be the last of the moon mis@@ sions , but I was absolutely certain there would be Mars colonies in my lifetime .
So &quot; Some@@ thing happened to our capacity to solve big problems with technology &quot; has become a com@@ mon@@ place .
You hear it all the time .
We &apos;ve heard it over the last two days here at TED .
It feels as if techno@@ logists have diver@@ ted us and en@@ ri@@ ched themselves with tri@@ vi@@ al to@@ ys , with things like iPh@@ ones and app@@ s and social media , or algorith@@ ms that speed autom@@ ated tr@@ ad@@ ing .
There &apos;s nothing wrong with most of these things .
They &apos;ve exp@@ and@@ ed and en@@ ri@@ ched our lives .
But they don &apos;t solve humanity &apos;s big problems .
What happened ?
So there is a par@@ o@@ chi@@ al explan@@ ation in Silicon Valley , which ad@@ m@@ its that it has been funding less ambi@@ tious companies than it did in the years when it fin@@ anced In@@ tel , Microsoft , Apple and Gen@@ ent@@ ech .
Silicon Valley says the markets are to bl@@ ame , in particular the incenti@@ ves that venture capitalis@@ ts offer to entrepreneurs .
Silicon Valley says that venture inv@@ esting shif@@ ted away from funding transform@@ ational ideas and towards funding incre@@ mental problems or even fa@@ ke problems .
But I don &apos;t think that explan@@ ation is good enough .
It mostly expl@@ ains what &apos;s wrong with Silicon Valley .
Even when venture capitalis@@ ts were at their most ris@@ k-@@ happy , they pre@@ fer@@ red small invest@@ ments , tiny invest@@ ments that off@@ ered an ex@@ it within 10 years .
V@@ .@@ C@@ .@@ s have always stru@@ ggl@@ ed to invest prof@@ it@@ ably in technologies such as energy whose capital requi@@ rem@@ ents are huge and whose development is long and l@@ eng@@ thy , and V@@ .@@ C@@ .@@ s have never , never fun@@ ded the development of technologies meant to solve big problems that poss@@ ess no immedi@@ ate commercial value .
No , the reasons we can &apos;t solve big problems are more complicated and more profound .
Sometimes we choose not to solve big problems .
We could go to Mars if we want .
NASA even has the out@@ line of a plan .
But going to Mars would follow a political decision with popular appe@@ al , and that will never happen .
We won &apos;t go to Mars , because everyone thinks there are more important things to do here on Earth .
Sometimes , we can &apos;t solve big problems because our political systems fail .
Today , less than two percent of the world &apos;s energy consumption der@@ i@@ ves from advanced , ren@@ ew@@ able sources such as solar , wind and bio@@ fu@@ els , less than two percent , and the reason is pu@@ rely economic .
Co@@ al and natural gas are che@@ aper than solar and wind , and pe@@ tr@@ ol@@ eum is che@@ aper than bio@@ fu@@ els .
We want alternative energy sources that can com@@ pe@@ te on price . N@@ one exist .
Now , techno@@ logists , business leaders and econom@@ ists all basically agree on what national polici@@ es and international tre@@ ati@@ es would s@@ pu@@ r the development of alternative energy : mostly , a significant increase in energy research and development , and some kind of price on carbon .
But there &apos;s no hope in the present political climate that we will see U.S. energy policy or international tre@@ ati@@ es that refl@@ ect that con@@ sen@@ sus .
Sometimes , big problems that had seemed techno@@ logical turn out not to be so .
F@@ am@@ ines were long understood to be caused by failu@@ res in food supply .
But 30 years of research have taught us that fam@@ ines are political cris@@ es that catastr@@ oph@@ ically affect food distribution .
T@@ echno@@ logy can improve things like cro@@ p y@@ i@@ el@@ ds or systems for stor@@ ing and transport@@ ing food , but there will be fam@@ ines so long as there are bad governments .
Fin@@ ally , big problems sometimes el@@ u@@ de solution because we don &apos;t really understand the problem .
President Ni@@ x@@ on dec@@ lar@@ ed war on cancer in 197@@ 1 , but we soon discovered there are many kinds of cancer , most of them fi@@ end@@ ish@@ ly res@@ istant to therapy , and it is only in the last 10 years that effective , vi@@ able therap@@ ies have come to seem real .
H@@ ard problems are hard .
It &apos;s not true that we can &apos;t solve big problems through technology .
We can , we must , but these four elements must all be present : Po@@ li@@ tical leaders and the public must care to solve a problem ; institutions must support its solution ; It must really be a techno@@ logical problem ; and we must understand it .
The A@@ poll@@ o mission , which has become a kind of metaphor for technology &apos;s capacity to solve big problems , met these cr@@ it@@ eria .
But it is an ir@@ re@@ produ@@ ci@@ ble model for the future .
It is not 196@@ 1 .
There is no gal@@ van@@ izing cont@@ est like the C@@ old War , no politici@@ an like John Ken@@ ne@@ dy who can her@@ o@@ ize the difficult and the dangerous , and no popular science fic@@ tional my@@ tho@@ logy such as explor@@ ing the solar system .
Most of all , going to the moon turned out to be easy .
It was just three days away .
And argu@@ ably it wasn &apos;t even solving much of a problem .
We are left alone with our day , and the solutions of the future will be harder won .
God knows , we don &apos;t lack for the challenges .
Thank you very much .
So I &apos;m going to talk about trust , and I &apos;m going to start by re@@ min@@ ding you of the standard vie@@ ws that people have about trust .
I think these are so com@@ mon@@ place , they &apos;ve become cli@@ ch@@ és of our society .
And I think there are three .
One &apos;s a claim : there has been a great dec@@ line in trust , very wid@@ ely believed .
The second is an ai@@ m : we should have more trust .
And the third is a task : we should re@@ build trust .
I think that the claim , the ai@@ m and the task are all mis@@ con@@ ce@@ ived .
So what I &apos;m going to try to tell you today is a different story about a claim , an ai@@ m and a task which I think give one quite a lot better pur@@ cha@@ se on the matter .
First the claim : Why do people think trust has dec@@ lin@@ ed ?
And if I really think about it on the basis of my own evidence , I don &apos;t know the answer .
I &apos;m in@@ clin@@ ed to think it may have dec@@ lin@@ ed in some acti@@ vi@@ ties or some institutions and it might have grown in others .
I don &apos;t have an over@@ view .
But , of course , I can look at the opinion pol@@ ls , and the opinion pol@@ ls are suppos@@ ed@@ ly the source of a belief that trust has dec@@ lin@@ ed .
When you actually look at opinion pol@@ ls across time , there &apos;s not much evidence for that .
That &apos;s to say , the people who were mis@@ tru@@ st@@ ed 20 years ago , princip@@ ally journalis@@ ts and politicians , are still mis@@ tru@@ st@@ ed .
And the people who were highly tru@@ st@@ ed 20 years ago are still rather highly tru@@ st@@ ed : jud@@ ges , nur@@ ses .
The rest of us are in between , and by the way , the average person in the street is almost exactly mid@@ way .
But is that good evidence ?
What opinion pol@@ ls record is , of course , opin@@ ions .
What else can they record ?
So they &apos;re looking at the gener@@ ic at@@ titudes that people report when you ask them certain questions .
Do you trust politicians ? Do you trust teachers ?
Now if somebody said to you , &quot; Do you trust green@@ gro@@ c@@ ers ?
Do you trust fish@@ mon@@ gers ?
Do you trust el@@ ement@@ ary school teachers ? &quot;
you would probably begin by saying , &quot; To do what ? &quot;
And that would be a perfectly sensi@@ ble response .
And you might say , when you understood the answer to that , &quot; Well , I trust some of them , but not others . &quot;
That &apos;s a perfectly rational thing .
In short , in our real lives , we see@@ k to place trust in a differ@@ enti@@ ated way .
We don &apos;t make an assu@@ mption that the level of trust that we will have in every instance of a certain type of offici@@ al or off@@ ic@@ e-@@ hol@@ der or type of person is going to be uni@@ form .
I might , for example , say that I certainly trust a certain el@@ ement@@ ary school teacher I know to teach the re@@ ception class to read , but in no way to drive the school min@@ i@@ bus .
I might , after all , know that she wasn &apos;t a good driver .
I might trust my most lo@@ qu@@ aci@@ ous friend to keep a conversation going but not -- but perhaps not to keep a secret .
Sim@@ ple .
So if we &apos;ve got those evidence in our ordinary lives of the way that trust is differ@@ enti@@ ated , why do we sort of drop all that intelligence when we think about trust more abstr@@ actly ?
I think the pol@@ ls are very bad gu@@ ides to the level of trust that actually exists , because they try to o@@ bl@@ iter@@ ate the good jud@@ gment that goes into plac@@ ing trust .
Sec@@ ond@@ ly , what about the ai@@ m ?
The ai@@ m is to have more trust .
Well fran@@ kly , I think that &apos;s a stupid ai@@ m .
It &apos;s not what I would ai@@ m at .
I would ai@@ m to have more trust in the tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thy but not in the un@@ tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thy .
In fact , I ai@@ m posi@@ tively to try not to trust the un@@ tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thy .
And I think , of those people who , for example , placed their sav@@ ings with the very ap@@ tly named Mr. M@@ ado@@ ff , who then made off with them , and I think of them , and I think , well , yes , too much trust .
More trust is not an intelligent ai@@ m in this life .
In@@ tel@@ lig@@ ently placed and intellig@@ ently ref@@ used trust is the pro@@ per ai@@ m .
Well once one says that , one says , yeah , okay , that means that what matters in the first place is not trust but tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess .
It &apos;s jud@@ ging how tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thy people are in particular resp@@ ects .
And I think that jud@@ gment requires us to look at three things .
Are they comp@@ et@@ ent ? Are they honest ? Are they reli@@ able ?
And if we find that a person is comp@@ et@@ ent in the relevant matters , and reli@@ able and honest , we &apos;ll have a pretty good reason to trust them , because they &apos;ll be tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thy .
But if , on the other hand , they &apos;re un@@ reli@@ able , we might not .
I have friends who are comp@@ et@@ ent and honest , but I would not trust them to pos@@ t a letter , because they &apos;re for@@ get@@ ful .
I have friends who are very confi@@ dent they can do certain things , but I realize that they over@@ estim@@ ate their own comp@@ et@@ ence .
And I &apos;m very gl@@ ad to say , I don &apos;t think I have many friends who are comp@@ et@@ ent and reli@@ able but extremely dis@@ honest .
If so , I haven &apos;t yet spo@@ t@@ ted it .
But that &apos;s what we &apos;re looking for : tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess before trust .
Tr@@ ust is the response .
Tr@@ u@@ st@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess is what we have to ju@@ dge .
And , of course , it &apos;s difficult .
A@@ cross the last few decades , we &apos;ve tried to construc@@ t systems of accoun@@ t@@ ability for all sorts of institutions and professi@@ on@@ als and offici@@ als and so on that will make it easier for us to ju@@ dge their tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess .
A lot of these systems have the con@@ verse effect .
They don &apos;t work as they &apos;re supposed to .
I remember I was talking with a mid@@ wife who said , &quot; Well , you see , the problem is it takes longer to do the pap@@ er@@ work than to deliver the baby . &quot;
And all over our public life , our institu@@ tional life , we find that problem , that the system of accoun@@ t@@ ability that is meant to sec@@ ure tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess and evidence of tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess is actually doing the opposite .
It is dis@@ trac@@ ting people who have to do difficult tas@@ ks , like mid@@ wi@@ ves , from doing them by requ@@ ir@@ ing them to tic@@ k the box@@ es , as we say .
You can all give your own examples there .
So so much for the ai@@ m .
The ai@@ m , I think , is more tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess , and that is going to be different if we are trying to be tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thy and communicate our tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess to other people , and if we are trying to ju@@ dge whether other people or off@@ ic@@ e-@@ hol@@ ders or politicians are tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thy .
It &apos;s not easy . It is jud@@ gment , and simple reaction , at@@ titudes , don &apos;t do a@@ de@@ qu@@ ately here .
Now thir@@ dly , the task .
C@@ all@@ ing the task re@@ building trust , I think , also gets things back@@ wards .
It suggests that you and I should re@@ build trust .
Well , we can do that for ourselves .
We can re@@ build a bit of tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess .
We can do it two people together trying to improve trust .
But trust , in the end , is distinc@@ tive because it &apos;s given by other people .
You can &apos;t re@@ build what other people give you .
You have to give them the basis for giving you their trust .
So you have to , I think , be tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thy .
And that , of course , is because you can &apos;t fo@@ ol all of the people all of the time , usually .
But you also have to provide us@@ able evidence that you are tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thy .
How to do it ?
Well every day , all over the place , it &apos;s being done by ordinary people , by offici@@ als , by institutions , quite effectively .
Let me give you a simple commercial example .
The shop where I buy my so@@ cks says I may take them back , and they don &apos;t ask any questions .
They take them back and give me the money or give me the pair of so@@ cks of the color I wanted .
That &apos;s super . I trust them because they have made themselves vulnerable to me .
I think there &apos;s a big lesson in that .
If you make yourself vulnerable to the other party , then that is very good evidence that you are tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thy and you have confidence in what you are saying .
So in the end , I think what we are aim@@ ing for is not very difficult to dis@@ cer@@ n .
It is relationships in which people are tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thy and can ju@@ dge when and how the other person is tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thy .
So the moral of all this is , we need to think much less about trust , let alone about at@@ titudes of trust det@@ ected or mis@@ -@@ det@@ ected by opinion pol@@ ls , much more about being tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thy , and how you give people a@@ de@@ qu@@ ate , useful and simple evidence that you &apos;re tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thy .
Thanks .
Th@@ rough@@ out the history of computers we &apos;ve been str@@ iv@@ ing to shor@@ ten the gap between us and digital information , the gap between our physical world and the world in the screen where our imagination can go wild .
And this gap has become shor@@ ter , shor@@ ter , and even shor@@ ter , and now this gap is shor@@ ten@@ ed down to less than a milli@@ meter , the th@@ ick@@ ness of a tou@@ ch@@ -@@ screen glass , and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone .
But I wonder@@ ed , what if there could be no b@@ ound@@ ary at all ?
I started to imagine what this would look like .
First , I created this tool which pen@@ e@@ tr@@ ates into the digital space , so when you press it hard on the screen , it trans@@ f@@ ers its physical body into pi@@ x@@ els .
Des@@ ign@@ ers can materi@@ alize their ideas directly in 3D , and surge@@ ons can practice on virtual org@@ ans underneath the screen .
So with this tool , this b@@ ound@@ ary has been broken .
But our two hands still remain outside the screen .
How can you reach inside and interact with the digital information using the full d@@ ex@@ ter@@ ity of our hands ?
At Microsoft Ap@@ pli@@ ed Sci@@ ences , along with my ment@@ or C@@ at@@ i B@@ oul@@ anger , I re@@ designed the computer and turned a little space above the ke@@ y@@ board into a digital work@@ space .
By combin@@ ing a transparent dis@@ play and de@@ p@@ th cameras for sen@@ sing your fin@@ gers and face , now you can li@@ ft up your hands from the ke@@ y@@ board and reach inside this 3D space and gra@@ b pi@@ x@@ els with your b@@ are hands .
Because windo@@ ws and fi@@ les have a position in the real space , sel@@ ecting them is as easy as gr@@ ab@@ bing a book off your shel@@ f .
Then you can fli@@ p through this book while high@@ li@@ ghting the lines , words on the virtual touch p@@ ad below each flo@@ ating window .
Ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ects can stre@@ t@@ ch or rot@@ ate the models with their two hands directly .
So in these examples , we are reach@@ ing into the digital world .
But how about re@@ vers@@ ing its role and having the digital information reach us instead ?
I &apos;m sure many of us have had the experience of buying and re@@ turning it@@ ems online .
But now you don &apos;t have to worry about it .
What I got here is an online augment@@ ed f@@ itting room .
This is a view that you get from hea@@ d-@@ m@@ oun@@ ted or se@@ e-@@ through dis@@ play when the system underst@@ ands the ge@@ om@@ etry of your body .
T@@ aking this idea further , I started to think , instead of just seeing these pi@@ x@@ els in our space , how can we make it physical so that we can touch and feel it ?
What would such a future look like ?
At MIT Me@@ dia Lab , along with my ad@@ vis@@ or H@@ i@@ ro@@ sh@@ i I@@ shi@@ i and my collabor@@ ator Re@@ h@@ mi Po@@ st , we created this one physical pi@@ x@@ el .
Well , in this case , this sp@@ her@@ ical mag@@ net acts like a 3D pi@@ x@@ el in our space , which means that both computers and people can move this object to anywhere within this little 3D space .
What we did was essentially can@@ cel@@ ing grav@@ ity and controll@@ ing the movement by combin@@ ing mag@@ ne@@ tic lev@@ itation and mechan@@ ical actu@@ ation and sen@@ sing technologies .
And by dig@@ it@@ ally program@@ ming the object , we are liber@@ ating the object from con@@ str@@ ain@@ ts of time and space , which means that now , human mo@@ tions can be recor@@ ded and played back and left perman@@ ently in the physical world .
So cho@@ re@@ ograph@@ y can be taught physi@@ cally over distance and Michael J@@ ord@@ an &apos;s famous sho@@ oting can be replic@@ ated over and over as a physical reality .
Stu@@ dents can use this as a tool to learn about the complex concepts such as plan@@ et@@ ary motion , physics , and un@@ like computer scre@@ ens or t@@ ext@@ books , this is a real , t@@ ang@@ ible experience that you can touch and feel , and it &apos;s very powerful .
And what &apos;s more exciting than just turning what &apos;s currently in the computer physical is to start imagin@@ ing how program@@ ming the world will al@@ ter even our daily physical acti@@ vi@@ ties .
As you can see , the digital information will not just show us something but it will start directly acting upon us as a part of our physical surr@@ oun@@ dings without dis@@ connec@@ ting ourselves from our world .
Today , we started by talking about the b@@ ound@@ ary , but if we re@@ move this b@@ ound@@ ary , the only b@@ ound@@ ary left is our imagination .
Thank you .
So I was trained to become a gy@@ m@@ n@@ ast for two years in Hun@@ an , China in the 197@@ 0s .
When I was in the first grade , the government wanted to trans@@ fer me to a school for ath@@ let@@ es , all expen@@ ses paid .
But my ti@@ ger mother said , &quot; No . &quot;
My parents wanted me to become an engineer like them .
After survi@@ ving the C@@ ul@@ tural R@@ evolution , they fir@@ m@@ ly believed there &apos;s only one sure way to happiness : a safe and well-@@ paid job .
It is not important if I like the job or not .
But my dream was to become a Chinese op@@ era sing@@ er .
That is me playing my imagin@@ ary piano .
An op@@ era sing@@ er must start training young to learn acro@@ b@@ ati@@ cs , so I tried everything I could to go to op@@ era school .
I even wrote to the school principal and the ho@@ st of a radio show .
But no adults liked the idea .
No adults believed I was serious .
On@@ ly my friends sup@@ ported me , but they were kids , just as power@@ less as I was .
So at age 15 , I knew I was too old to be trained .
My dream would never come true .
I was afraid that for the rest of my life some secon@@ d-@@ class happiness would be the best I could hope for .
But that &apos;s so un@@ fair .
So I was determin@@ ed to find another calling .
No@@ body around to teach me ? F@@ ine .
I turned to books .
I satis@@ fied my hun@@ ger for par@@ ental ad@@ vice from this book by a family of writ@@ ers and musici@@ ans . &#91; &quot; Cor@@ respon@@ dence in the F@@ am@@ ily of F@@ ou Le@@ i &quot; &#93; I found my role model of an independent woman when Con@@ fu@@ ci@@ an tradition requires o@@ be@@ dience . &#91; &quot; J@@ ane E@@ y@@ re &quot; &#93; And I learned to be efficient from this book . &#91; &quot; Ch@@ e@@ aper by the Do@@ zen &quot; &#93; And I was inspired to study ab@@ road after reading these .
&#91; &quot; Com@@ ple@@ te Wor@@ ks of San@@ ma@@ o &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; L@@ ess@@ ons From H@@ ist@@ ory &quot; by N@@ an Hu@@ ai@@ j@@ in &#93; I came to the U.S. in 199@@ 5 , so which books did I read here first ?
B@@ oo@@ ks b@@ ann@@ ed in China , of course .
&quot; The Good Earth &quot; is about Chinese pe@@ as@@ ant life .
That &apos;s just not conven@@ ient for propag@@ anda . G@@ ot it .
The Bible is interesting , but strange .
That &apos;s a top@@ ic for a different day .
But the fi@@ f@@ th comman@@ d@@ ment gave me an epi@@ ph@@ any : &quot; You shall hon@@ or your father and mother . &quot;
&quot; H@@ on@@ or , &quot; I said . &quot; That &apos;s so different , and better , than o@@ be@@ y . &quot;
So it becomes my tool to clim@@ b out of this Con@@ fu@@ ci@@ an gu@@ il@@ t tra@@ p and to rest@@ art my relationship with my parents .
En@@ counter@@ ing a new culture also started my hab@@ it of compar@@ ative reading .
It off@@ ers many insi@@ ghts .
For example , I found this map out of place at first because this is what Chinese students grew up with .
It had never occur@@ red to me , China doesn &apos;t have to be at the center of the world .
A map actually car@@ ries somebody &apos;s view .
Com@@ par@@ ative reading actually is nothing new .
It &apos;s a standard practice in the academ@@ ic world .
There are even research fields such as compar@@ ative religion and compar@@ ative liter@@ ature .
Com@@ pare and contr@@ ast gives sch@@ ol@@ ars a more complete understanding of a top@@ ic .
So I thought , well , if compar@@ ative reading works for research , why not do it in daily life too ?
So I started reading books in pairs .
So they can be about people -- &#91; &quot; Ben@@ jam@@ in Fr@@ ank@@ lin &quot; by Wal@@ ter I@@ sa@@ ac@@ son &#93; &#91; &quot; John A@@ dam@@ s &quot; by David Mc@@ C@@ ul@@ l@@ ough &#93; -- who are involved in the same event , or friends with shared experiences .
&#91; &quot; Per@@ s@@ onal H@@ ist@@ ory &quot; by K@@ ath@@ ar@@ ine G@@ ra@@ h@@ am &#93; &#91; &quot; The S@@ now@@ ball : War@@ ren Bu@@ ff@@ et@@ t and the B@@ us@@ iness of Life , &quot; by A@@ lice Sch@@ ro@@ e@@ der &#93; I also compare the same stories in different gen@@ res -- &#91; Ho@@ ly Bible : King James Ver@@ sion &#93; &#91; &quot; L@@ am@@ b &quot; by Chris@@ opher Moore &#93; -- or similar stories from different cultures , as Jo@@ sep@@ h Cam@@ p@@ b@@ ell did in his wonderful book . &#91; &quot; The Po@@ wer of My@@ th &quot; by Jo@@ sep@@ h Cam@@ p@@ b@@ ell &#93; For example , both the Chris@@ t and the Bu@@ dd@@ ha
went through three temp@@ tations .
For the Chris@@ t , the temp@@ tations are economic , political and spiritu@@ al .
For the Bu@@ dd@@ ha , they are all psycho@@ logical : l@@ ust , fear and social du@@ ty -- interesting .
So if you know a foreign language , it &apos;s also fun to read your favorite books in two languages .
&#91; &quot; The W@@ ay of C@@ hu@@ ang T@@ z@@ u &quot; Thomas Mer@@ ton &#93; &#91; &quot; T@@ a@@ o : The Wat@@ er@@ course W@@ ay &quot; Al@@ an Wat@@ ts &#93; Instead of lost in trans@@ lation , I found there is much to gain .
For example , it &apos;s through trans@@ lation that I realized &quot; happiness &quot; in Chinese literally means &quot; fast joy . &quot; Hu@@ h !
&quot; Bri@@ de &quot; in Chinese literally means &quot; new mother . &quot; U@@ h@@ -@@ oh .
B@@ oo@@ ks have given me a magic port@@ al to connect with people of the past and the present .
I know I shall never feel lon@@ ely or power@@ less again .
H@@ aving a dream sh@@ at@@ tered really is nothing compared to what many others have suff@@ ered .
I have come to believe that coming true is not the only purpose of a dream .
I@@ ts most important purpose is to get us in touch with where dreams come from , where passion comes from , where happiness comes from .
Even a sh@@ at@@ tered dream can do that for you .
So because of books , I &apos;m here today , happy , living again with a purpose and a cl@@ ar@@ ity , most of the time .
So may books be always with you .
Thank you .
Thank you . Thank you .
When I was in my 20@@ s , I saw my very first psycho@@ therapy client .
I was a Ph@@ .@@ D@@ . student in clinical psycho@@ logy at Ber@@ k@@ el@@ ey .
She was a 2@@ 6@@ -year-old woman named Ale@@ x .
Now Ale@@ x walked into her first s@@ ession wearing je@@ ans and a big sl@@ ou@@ ch@@ y top , and she dro@@ pped onto the cou@@ ch in my office and k@@ ic@@ ked off her fl@@ ats and told me she was there to talk about guy problems .
Now when I heard this , I was so reli@@ ev@@ ed .
My class@@ mate got an ar@@ son@@ ist for her first client .
And I got a tw@@ ent@@ y@@ something who wanted to talk about boys .
This I thought I could hand@@ le .
But I didn &apos;t hand@@ le it .
With the funny stories that Ale@@ x would bring to s@@ ession , it was easy for me just to no@@ d my head while we k@@ ic@@ ked the can down the road .
&quot; Th@@ ir@@ ty &apos;s the new 20 , &quot; Ale@@ x would say , and as far as I could tell , she was right .
Wor@@ k happened later , marriage happened later , kids happened later , even death happened later .
Tw@@ ent@@ y@@ some@@ things like Ale@@ x and I had nothing but time .
But before long , my super@@ vis@@ or push@@ ed me to push Ale@@ x about her love life .
I push@@ ed back .
I said , &quot; Su@@ re , she &apos;s d@@ ating down , she &apos;s sle@@ e@@ ping with a k@@ nu@@ ck@@ le@@ head , but it &apos;s not like she &apos;s going to mar@@ ry the guy . &quot;
And then my super@@ vis@@ or said , &quot; Not yet , but she might mar@@ ry the next one .
B@@ es@@ ides , the best time to work on Ale@@ x &apos;s marriage is before she has one . &quot;
That &apos;s what psycho@@ logists call an &quot; A@@ ha ! &quot; moment .
That was the moment I realized , 30 is not the new 20 .
Yes , people set@@ tle down later than they used to , but that didn &apos;t make Ale@@ x &apos;s 20@@ s a develop@@ mental down@@ time .
That made Ale@@ x &apos;s 20@@ s a develop@@ mental swe@@ et spot , and we were sitting there , blo@@ wing it .
That was when I realized that this sort of ben@@ ign ne@@ gl@@ ect was a real problem , and it had real consequences , not just for Ale@@ x and her love life but for the care@@ ers and the families and the fu@@ tures of tw@@ ent@@ y@@ some@@ things everywhere .
There are 50 million tw@@ ent@@ y@@ some@@ things in the United States right now .
We &apos;re talking about 15 percent of the population , or 100 percent if you consider that no one &apos;s getting through adul@@ th@@ ood without going through their 20@@ s first .
R@@ aise your hand if you &apos;re in your 20@@ s .
I really want to see some tw@@ ent@@ y@@ some@@ things here .
Oh , y@@ ay ! You are all awesome .
If you work with tw@@ ent@@ y@@ some@@ things , you love a tw@@ ent@@ y@@ something , you &apos;re losing sleep over tw@@ ent@@ y@@ some@@ things , I want to see — Okay . A@@ w@@ esome , tw@@ ent@@ y@@ some@@ things really matter .
So , I speci@@ alize in tw@@ ent@@ y@@ some@@ things because I believe that every single one of those 50 million tw@@ ent@@ y@@ some@@ things des@@ er@@ ves to know what psycho@@ logists , soci@@ o@@ logists , neuro@@ logists and fer@@ til@@ ity speci@@ alis@@ ts already know : that cl@@ aim@@ ing your 20@@ s is one of the simpl@@ est , yet most transform@@ ative , things you can do for work , for love , for your happiness , maybe even for the world .
This is not my opinion . These are the facts .
We know that 80 percent of life &apos;s most defin@@ ing moments take place by age 35 .
That means that eight out of 10 of the decisions and experiences and &quot; A@@ ha ! &quot; moments that make your life what it is will have happened by your mi@@ d-@@ 3@@ 0s .
People who are over 40 , don &apos;t pan@@ ic .
This crow@@ d is going to be fine , I think .
We know that the first 10 years of a career has an exponenti@@ al impact on how much money you &apos;re going to ear@@ n .
We know that more than half of Americans are married or are living with or d@@ ating their future partner by 30 .
We know that the brain cap@@ s off its second and last growth s@@ pur@@ t in your 20@@ s as it re@@ wi@@ res itself for adul@@ th@@ ood , which means that whatever it is you want to change about yourself , now is the time to change it .
We know that person@@ ality changes more during your 20@@ s than at any other time in life , and we know that female fer@@ til@@ ity pea@@ ks at age 28 , and things get tric@@ ky after age 35 .
So your 20@@ s are the time to educ@@ ate yourself about your body and your options .
So when we think about child development , we all know that the first five years are a critical period for language and atta@@ ch@@ ment in the brain .
It &apos;s a time when your ordinary , d@@ ay@@ -@@ to-@@ day life has an in@@ ordin@@ ate impact on who you will become .
But what we hear less about is that there &apos;s such a thing as adult development , and our 20@@ s are that critical period of adult development .
But this isn &apos;t what tw@@ ent@@ y@@ some@@ things are hearing .
New@@ sp@@ ap@@ ers talk about the changing ti@@ met@@ able of adul@@ th@@ ood .
Res@@ ear@@ chers call the 20@@ s an ext@@ ended adolesc@@ ence .
J@@ our@@ n@@ alis@@ ts coin sil@@ ly n@@ ick@@ names for tw@@ ent@@ y@@ some@@ things like &quot; tw@@ i@@ x@@ ters &quot; and &quot; kid@@ ul@@ ts . &quot;
It &apos;s true !
As a culture , we have tri@@ vi@@ alized what is actually the defin@@ ing decade of adul@@ th@@ ood .
Le@@ on@@ ard Ber@@ n@@ st@@ ein said that to achieve great things , you need a plan and not quite enough time .
Is@@ n &apos;t that true ?
So what do you think happens when you p@@ at a tw@@ ent@@ y@@ something on the head and you say , &quot; You have 10 extra years to start your life &quot; ?
No@@ thing happens .
You have rob@@ bed that person of his ur@@ gency and ambi@@ tion , and absolutely nothing happens .
And then every day , smart , interesting tw@@ ent@@ y@@ some@@ things like you or like your sons and dau@@ gh@@ ters come into my office and say things like this : &quot; I know my bo@@ y@@ friend &apos;s no good for me , but this relationship doesn &apos;t count . I &apos;m just killing time . &quot;
Or they say , &quot; Everybody says as long as I get started on a career by the time I &apos;m 30 , I &apos;ll be fine . &quot;
But then it starts to sound like this : &quot; My 20@@ s are almost over , and I have nothing to show for myself .
I had a better ré@@ sum@@ é the day after I gradu@@ ated from college . &quot;
And then it starts to sound like this : &quot; D@@ ating in my 20@@ s was like musical ch@@ airs .
Everybody was running around and having fun , but then some@@ time around 30 it was like the music turned off and everybody started sitting down .
I didn &apos;t want to be the only one left standing up , so sometimes I think I married my husband because he was the clo@@ s@@ est chair to me at 30 . &quot;
Where are the tw@@ ent@@ y@@ some@@ things here ?
Do not do that .
Okay , now that sounds a little fli@@ p , but make no mis@@ take , the st@@ akes are very high .
When a lot has been push@@ ed to your 3@@ 0s , there is enormous thir@@ ty@@ something pressure to ju@@ mp@@ -@@ start a career , pick a city , partner up , and have two or three kids in a much shor@@ ter period of time .
Many of these things are in@@ compati@@ ble , and as research is just starting to show , simply harder and more str@@ ess@@ ful to do all at once in our 3@@ 0s .
The post-@@ mill@@ enni@@ al mid@@ life crisis isn &apos;t buying a red sports car .
It &apos;s realiz@@ ing you can &apos;t have that career you now want .
It &apos;s realiz@@ ing you can &apos;t have that child you now want , or you can &apos;t give your child a si@@ bling .
To@@ o many thir@@ ty@@ some@@ things and for@@ ty@@ some@@ things look at themselves , and at me , sitting across the room , and say about their 20@@ s , &quot; What was I doing ? What was I thinking ? &quot;
I want to change what tw@@ ent@@ y@@ some@@ things are doing and thinking .
Here &apos;s a story about how that can go .
It &apos;s a story about a woman named Em@@ ma .
At 25 , Em@@ ma came to my office because she was , in her words , having an identity crisis .
She said she thought she might like to work in art or entert@@ ain@@ ment , but she hadn &apos;t decided yet , so she &apos;d spent the last few years waiting tables instead .
Because it was che@@ aper , she lived with a bo@@ y@@ friend who dis@@ played his temp@@ er more than his ambi@@ tion .
And as hard as her 20@@ s were , her early life had been even harder .
She often cri@@ ed in our s@@ essions , but then would collect her@@ self by saying , &quot; You can &apos;t pick your family , but you can pick your friends . &quot;
Well one day , Em@@ ma comes in and she h@@ ang@@ s her head in her la@@ p , and she so@@ b@@ bed for most of the hour .
She &apos;d just bought a new address book , and she &apos;d spent the morning f@@ illing in her many cont@@ acts , but then she &apos;d been left star@@ ing at that empty bl@@ ank that comes after the words &quot; In case of emer@@ gency , please call ... &quot;
She was nearly hy@@ ster@@ ical when she looked at me and said , &quot; Who &apos;s going to be there for me if I get in a car w@@ rec@@ k ?
Who &apos;s going to take care of me if I have cancer ? &quot;
Now in that moment , it took everything I had not to say , &quot; I will . &quot;
But what Em@@ ma needed wasn &apos;t some therap@@ ist who really , really car@@ ed .
Em@@ ma needed a better life , and I knew this was her chance .
I had learned too much since I first worked with Ale@@ x to just sit there while Em@@ ma &apos;s defin@@ ing decade went par@@ ad@@ ing by .
So over the next weeks and months , I told Em@@ ma three things that every tw@@ ent@@ y@@ something , male or female , des@@ er@@ ves to hear .
First , I told Em@@ ma to forget about having an identity crisis and get some identity capital .
By &quot; get identity capital , &quot; I mean do something that ad@@ ds value to who you are .
Do something that &apos;s an investment in who you might want to be next .
I didn &apos;t know the future of Em@@ ma &apos;s career , and no one knows the future of work , but I do know this : I@@ denti@@ ty capital be@@ gets identity capital .
So now is the time for that cross@@ -@@ country job , that intern@@ ship , that star@@ tu@@ p you want to try .
I &apos;m not dis@@ coun@@ ting tw@@ ent@@ y@@ something exploration here , but I am dis@@ coun@@ ting exploration that &apos;s not supposed to count , which , by the way , is not exploration .
That &apos;s pro@@ cr@@ as@@ tin@@ ation .
I told Em@@ ma to explore work and make it count .
Second , I told Em@@ ma that the urban tri@@ be is over@@ r@@ ated .
B@@ est friends are great for giving ri@@ des to the air@@ port , but tw@@ ent@@ y@@ some@@ things who hu@@ dd@@ le together with lik@@ e-@@ min@@ ded pe@@ ers lim@@ it who they know , what they know , how they think , how they speak , and where they work .
That new piece of capital , that new person to date almost always comes from outside the inner circle .
New things come from what are called our wea@@ k ties , our friends of friends of friends .
So yes , half of tw@@ ent@@ y@@ some@@ things are un@@ - or under@@ -@@ employ@@ ed .
But half aren &apos;t , and wea@@ k ties are how you get yourself into that group .
H@@ al@@ f of new jobs are never pos@@ ted , so reach@@ ing out to your neighb@@ or &apos;s bo@@ ss is how you get that un@@ pos@@ ted job .
It &apos;s not che@@ ating . It &apos;s the science of how information sp@@ re@@ ads .
Last but not least , Em@@ ma believed that you can &apos;t pick your family , but you can pick your friends .
Now this was true for her growing up , but as a tw@@ ent@@ y@@ something , soon Em@@ ma would pick her family when she part@@ ner@@ ed with someone and created a family of her own .
I told Em@@ ma the time to start pic@@ king your family is now .
Now you may be thinking that 30 is actually a better time to set@@ tle down than 20 , or even 25 , and I agree with you .
But gr@@ ab@@ bing wh@@ o@@ ever you &apos;re living with or sle@@ e@@ ping with when everyone on Facebook starts walking down the ais@@ le is not progress .
The best time to work on your marriage is before you have one , and that means being as in@@ tenti@@ onal with love as you are with work .
P@@ ic@@ king your family is about consci@@ ously cho@@ os@@ ing who and what you want rather than just making it work or killing time with wh@@ o@@ ever happens to be cho@@ os@@ ing you .
So what happened to Em@@ ma ?
Well , we went through that address book , and she found an old ro@@ om@@ mate &apos;s cous@@ in who worked at an art museum in another state .
That wea@@ k tie helped her get a job there .
That job offer gave her the reason to leave that li@@ ve-@@ in bo@@ y@@ friend .
Now , five years later , she &apos;s a special events plann@@ er for mus@@ eu@@ ms .
She &apos;s married to a man she min@@ d@@ fully chose .
She lo@@ ves her new career , she lo@@ ves her new family , and she sent me a card that said , &quot; Now the emer@@ gency contact blan@@ ks don &apos;t seem big enough . &quot;
Now Em@@ ma &apos;s story made that sound easy , but that &apos;s what I love about working with tw@@ ent@@ y@@ some@@ things .
They are so easy to help .
Tw@@ ent@@ y@@ some@@ things are like air@@ plan@@ es just leaving L@@ A@@ X , b@@ ound for somewhere west .
Right after ta@@ ke@@ off , a s@@ light change in course is the difference between l@@ anding in Al@@ as@@ ka or Fi@@ j@@ i .
Li@@ ke@@ wise , at 21 or 25 or even 29 , one good conversation , one good break , one good TED Talk , can have an enormous effect across years and even generations to come .
So here &apos;s an idea worth sp@@ reading to every tw@@ ent@@ y@@ something you know .
It &apos;s as simple as what I learned to say to Ale@@ x .
It &apos;s what I now have the privil@@ e@@ ge of saying to tw@@ ent@@ y@@ some@@ things like Em@@ ma every single day : Th@@ ir@@ ty is not the new 20 , so claim your adul@@ th@@ ood , get some identity capital , use your wea@@ k ties , pick your family .
Don &apos;t be defined by what you didn &apos;t know or didn &apos;t do .
You &apos;re dec@@ id@@ ing your life right now .
Thank you .
When I was 27 years old , I left a very demand@@ ing job in management consul@@ ting for a job that was even more demand@@ ing : teaching .
I went to teach sev@@ ent@@ h grad@@ ers math in the New York City public schools .
And like any teacher , I made qu@@ iz@@ zes and tests .
I gave out hom@@ ework as@@ sign@@ ments .
When the work came back , I calcul@@ ated gr@@ ades .
What struc@@ k me was that I@@ Q was not the only difference between my best and my worst students .
Some of my strong@@ est perform@@ ers did not have str@@ ato@@ sp@@ her@@ ic I@@ Q s@@ cor@@ es .
Some of my smar@@ test kids weren &apos;t doing so well .
And that got me thinking .
The kinds of things you need to learn in sev@@ ent@@ h grade math , sure , they &apos;re hard : rati@@ os , dec@@ im@@ als , the area of a parall@@ el@@ o@@ gram .
But these concepts are not impossible , and I was fir@@ m@@ ly convinced that every one of my students could learn the material if they worked hard and long enough .
After several more years of teaching , I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a much better understanding of students and learning from a motiv@@ ational perspective , from a psycho@@ logical perspective .
In education , the one thing we know how to measure best is I@@ Q .
But what if doing well in school and in life depends on much more than your ability to learn quickly and easily ?
So I left the classroom , and I went to graduate school to become a psycho@@ logist .
I started studying kids and adults in all kinds of super challeng@@ ing sett@@ ings , and in every study my question was , who is successful here and why ?
My research team and I went to West Po@@ int Mil@@ it@@ ary Ac@@ adem@@ y .
We tried to predict which ca@@ de@@ ts would stay in military training and which would drop out .
We went to the National Sp@@ elling Be@@ e and tried to predict which children would adv@@ ance far@@ th@@ est in competition .
We studied ro@@ ok@@ ie teachers working in really tough neighbor@@ ho@@ ods , asking which teachers are still going to be here in teaching by the end of the school year , and of those , who will be the most effective at impro@@ ving learning out@@ comes for their students ?
We part@@ ner@@ ed with private companies , asking , which of these sal@@ es@@ people is going to keep their jobs ?
And who &apos;s going to ear@@ n the most money ?
In all those very different contex@@ ts , one character@@ istic emerg@@ ed as a significant predic@@ tor of success .
And it wasn &apos;t social intelligence .
It wasn &apos;t good looks , physical health , and it wasn &apos;t I@@ Q .
It was gr@@ it .
Gr@@ it is passion and pers@@ ever@@ ance for very long-term goals .
Gr@@ it is having st@@ am@@ ina .
Gr@@ it is stic@@ king with your future , day in , day out , not just for the week , not just for the month , but for years , and working really hard to make that future a reality .
Gr@@ it is living life like it &apos;s a mar@@ ath@@ on , not a s@@ print .
A few years ago , I started studying gr@@ it in the Chicago public schools .
I asked thousands of high school j@@ uni@@ ors to take gr@@ it ques@@ ti@@ onn@@ aires , and then wai@@ ted around more than a year to see who would graduate .
Tur@@ ns out that gr@@ it@@ tier kids were signific@@ antly more likely to graduate , even when I mat@@ ched them on every character@@ istic I could measure , things like family income , stand@@ ar@@ di@@ zed achiev@@ ement test s@@ cor@@ es , even how safe kids felt when they were at school .
So it &apos;s not just at West Po@@ int or the National Sp@@ elling Be@@ e that gr@@ it matters . It &apos;s also in school , especially for kids at risk for dro@@ pping out .
To me , the most shoc@@ king thing about gr@@ it is how little we know , how little science knows , about building it .
Every day , parents and teachers ask me , &quot; How do I build gr@@ it in kids ?
What do I do to teach kids a soli@@ d work eth@@ ic ?
How do I keep them motiv@@ ated for the long run ? &quot;
The honest answer is , I don &apos;t know . What I do know is that talent doesn &apos;t make you gr@@ it@@ ty .
Our data show very clearly that there are many tal@@ ented individuals who simply do not follow through on their commit@@ ments .
In fact , in our data , gr@@ it is usually un@@ related or even in@@ ver@@ sely related to mea@@ sures of talent .
So far , the best idea I &apos;ve heard about building gr@@ it in kids is something called &quot; growth min@@ d@@ set . &quot;
This is an idea developed at Stanford University by Car@@ ol D@@ w@@ ec@@ k , and it is the belief that the ability to learn is not fix@@ ed , that it can change with your effort .
Dr. D@@ w@@ ec@@ k has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and gro@@ ws in response to challenge , they &apos;re much more likely to pers@@ ev@@ ere when they fail , because they don &apos;t believe that failure is a permanent condition .
So growth min@@ d@@ set is a great idea for building gr@@ it .
But we need more .
And that &apos;s where I &apos;m going to end my remar@@ ks , because that &apos;s where we are .
That &apos;s the work that st@@ ands before us .
We need to take our best ideas , our strong@@ est intu@@ i@@ tions , and we need to test them .
We need to measure whether we &apos;ve been successful , and we have to be willing to fail , to be wrong , to start over again with lessons learned .
In other words , we need to be gr@@ it@@ ty about getting our kids gr@@ it@@ tier .
Thank you .
Gro@@ wing up in T@@ ai@@ w@@ an as the daughter of a cal@@ li@@ grap@@ her , one of my most tre@@ a@@ su@@ red mem@@ ories was my mother showing me the beauty , the shape and the form of Chinese characters .
E@@ ver since then , I was fascin@@ ated by this incredible language .
But to an out@@ si@@ der , it seems to be as im@@ pen@@ e@@ tr@@ able as the Great W@@ all of China .
Over the past few years , I &apos;ve been wondering if I can break down this wall , so anyone who wants to understand and appreci@@ ate the beauty of this sophistic@@ ated language could do so .
I started thinking about how a new , fast method of learning Chinese might be useful .
Since the age of five , I started to learn how to draw every single str@@ oke for each character in the correct sequence .
I learned new characters every day during the course of the next 15 years .
Since we only have five minutes , it &apos;s better that we have a fast and simpl@@ er way .
A Chinese sch@@ ol@@ ar would understand 20@@ ,000 characters .
You only need 1,000 to understand the basic liter@@ acy .
The top 200 will allow you to com@@ pre@@ h@@ end 40 percent of basic liter@@ ature -- enough to read road signs , restaurant men@@ us , to understand the basic idea of the web pages or the newsp@@ ap@@ ers .
Today I &apos;m going to start with eight to show you how the method works .
You are ready ?
O@@ pen your mouth as wide as possible until it &apos;s square .
You get a mouth .
This is a person going for a walk .
Per@@ son .
If the shape of the fire is a person with two arms on both sides , as if she was y@@ elling fran@@ tically , &quot; Hel@@ p ! I &apos;m on fire ! &quot; -- This symbo@@ l actually is origin@@ ally from the shape of the fl@@ ame , but I like to think that way . Wh@@ i@@ ch@@ ever works for you .
This is a tree .
T@@ ree .
This is a mountain .
The sun .
The moon .
The symbo@@ l of the door looks like a pair of sal@@ o@@ on do@@ ors in the wild west .
I call these eight characters radic@@ als .
They are the building blocks for you to create lots more characters .
A person .
If someone wal@@ ks behind , that is &quot; to follow . &quot;
As the old saying goes , two is company , three is a crow@@ d .
If a person stre@@ t@@ ched their arms wide , this person is saying , &quot; It was this big . &quot;
The person inside the mouth , the person is tr@@ apped .
He &apos;s a pris@@ on@@ er , just like Jon@@ ah inside the wh@@ ale .
One tree is a tree . Two trees together , we have the woo@@ ds .
Three trees together , we create the forest .
P@@ ut a plan@@ k underneath the tree , we have the foundation .
P@@ ut a mouth on the top of the tree , that &apos;s &quot; idi@@ ot . &quot; E@@ as@@ y to remember , since a talking tree is pretty idi@@ o@@ tic .
Rem@@ ember fire ?
Two fi@@ res together , I get really hot .
Three fi@@ res together , that &apos;s a lot of fl@@ ames .
S@@ et the fire underneath the two trees , it &apos;s bur@@ ning .
For us , the sun is the source of pro@@ sper@@ ity .
Two su@@ ns together , pro@@ sper@@ ous .
Three together , that &apos;s s@@ par@@ k@@ les .
P@@ ut the sun and the moon sh@@ in@@ ing together , it &apos;s bri@@ ght@@ ness .
It also means tomorrow , after a day and a night .
The sun is coming up above the horiz@@ on . S@@ un@@ rise .
A door . P@@ ut a plan@@ k inside the door , it &apos;s a door b@@ ol@@ t .
P@@ ut a mouth inside the door , asking questions .
K@@ no@@ ck kno@@ ck . Is anyone home ?
This person is sn@@ ea@@ king out of a door , es@@ cap@@ ing , ev@@ ad@@ ing .
On the left , we have a woman .
Two women together , they have an argument .
Three women together , be care@@ ful , it &apos;s adul@@ tery .
So we have gone through almost 30 characters .
By using this method , the first eight radic@@ als will allow you to build 32 .
The next group of eight characters will build an extra 32 .
So with very little effort , you will be able to learn a couple hundred characters , which is the same as a Chinese e@@ igh@@ t-@@ year-old .
So after we know the characters , we start building ph@@ r@@ ases .
For example , the mountain and the fire together , we have fire mountain . It &apos;s a vol@@ can@@ o .
We know Japan is the land of the ris@@ ing sun .
This is a sun placed with the orig@@ in , because Japan lies to the e@@ ast of China .
So a sun , orig@@ in together , we build Japan .
A person behind Japan , what do we get ?
A Japanese person .
The character on the left is two mountains stac@@ ked on top of each other .
In ancient China , that means in ex@@ ile , because Chinese em@@ per@@ ors , they put their political enem@@ ies in ex@@ ile beyond mountains .
No@@ w@@ ad@@ ays , ex@@ ile has turned into getting out .
A mouth which tells you where to get out is an ex@@ it .
This is a slide to re@@ mind me that I should stop talking and get off of the stage . Thank you .
You know , my favorite part of being a dad is the movies I get to watch .
I love sharing my favorite movies with my kids , and when my daughter was four , we got to watch &quot; The W@@ iz@@ ard of O@@ z &quot; together .
It totally domin@@ ated her imagination for months .
Her favorite character was Gl@@ ind@@ a , of course .
It gave her a great ex@@ cu@@ se to wear a s@@ par@@ kly d@@ ress and carry a w@@ and .
But you watch that movie enough times , and you start to realize how unusual it is .
Now we live today , and are rais@@ ing our children , in a kind of children &apos;@@ s-@@ fantas@@ y-@@ spectac@@ ul@@ ar@@ -@@ industrial complex .
But &quot; The W@@ iz@@ ard of O@@ z &quot; stood alone .
It did not start that tr@@ end .
For@@ ty years later was when the tr@@ end really caught on , with , inter@@ est@@ ingly , another movie that fe@@ atu@@ red a met@@ al guy and a fur@@ ry guy res@@ cu@@ ing a girl by dr@@ essing up as the enem@@ y &apos;s gu@@ ards .
Do you know what I &apos;m talking about ? Yeah .
Now , there &apos;s a big difference between these two movies , a couple of really big differences between &quot; The W@@ iz@@ ard of O@@ z &quot; and all the movies we watch today .
One is there &apos;s very little violence in &quot; The W@@ iz@@ ard of O@@ z . &quot;
The mon@@ keys are rather ag@@ gr@@ essive , as are the app@@ le trees .
But I think if &quot; The W@@ iz@@ ard of O@@ z &quot; were made today , the w@@ iz@@ ard would say , &quot; D@@ or@@ o@@ thy , you are the sav@@ ior of O@@ z that the pro@@ ph@@ ec@@ y fore@@ told .
U@@ se your magic sli@@ p@@ pers to de@@ fe@@ at the compu@@ ter@@ -@@ gener@@ ated ar@@ mi@@ es of the W@@ ic@@ ked W@@ it@@ ch . &quot;
But that &apos;s not how it happens .
Another thing that &apos;s really unique about &quot; The W@@ iz@@ ard of O@@ z &quot; to me is that all of the most her@@ o@@ ic and wise and even vill@@ ain@@ ous characters are female .
Now I started to notice this when I actually showed &quot; St@@ ar W@@ ars &quot; to my daughter , which was years later , and the situation was different .
At that point I also had a son .
He was only three at the time .
He was not invited to the scre@@ ening . He was too young for that .
But he was the second child , and the level of super@@ vision had plu@@ m@@ met@@ ed . So he wan@@ der@@ ed in , and it im@@ prin@@ ted on him like a mom@@ my duc@@ k does to its duc@@ k@@ ling , and I don &apos;t think he underst@@ ands what &apos;s going on , but he is sure so@@ aking in it .
And I wonder what he &apos;s so@@ aking in .
Is he pic@@ king up on the them@@ es of courage and pers@@ ever@@ ance and lo@@ y@@ al@@ ty ?
Is he pic@@ king up on the fact that Lu@@ ke jo@@ ins an ar@@ my to over@@ throw the government ?
Is he pic@@ king up on the fact that there are only boys in the universe except for A@@ un@@ t Ber@@ u , and of course this pr@@ inc@@ ess , who &apos;s really cool , but who kind of wai@@ ts around through most of the movie so that she can aw@@ ard the her@@ o with a me@@ d@@ al and a win@@ k to thank him for saving the universe , which he does by the magic that he was born with ?
Com@@ pare this to 19@@ 3@@ 9 with &quot; The W@@ iz@@ ard of O@@ z . &quot;
How does D@@ or@@ o@@ thy win her movie ?
By making friends with everybody and being a leader .
That &apos;s kind of the world I &apos;d rather raise my kids in -- O@@ z , right ? -- and not the world of du@@ des fighting , which is where we kind of have to be .
Why is there so much For@@ ce -- capital F , For@@ ce -- in the movies we have for our kids , and so little yellow bri@@ ck road ?
There is a lot of great writing about the impact that the bo@@ y-@@ violent movie has on girls , and you should do that reading . It &apos;s very good .
I haven &apos;t read as much on how boys are pic@@ king up on this vi@@ be .
I know from my own experience that Pr@@ inc@@ ess Le@@ ia did not provide the a@@ de@@ qu@@ ate context that I could have used in navig@@ ating the adult world that is co-@@ ed . I think there was a fir@@ st-@@ k@@ is@@ s moment when I really expected the cre@@ d@@ its to start rol@@ ling because that &apos;s the end of the movie , right ?
I finished my qu@@ est , I got the girl .
Why are you still standing there ?
I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m supposed to do .
The movies are very , very focused on de@@ fe@@ ating the vill@@ ain and getting your re@@ ward , and there &apos;s not a lot of room for other relationships and other jour@@ ne@@ ys .
It &apos;s almost as though if you &apos;re a boy , you are a dop@@ ey animal , and if you are a girl , you should bring your w@@ arri@@ or co@@ stu@@ me .
There are pl@@ enty of excep@@ tions , and I will def@@ end the Dis@@ ney pr@@ inc@@ esses in front of any you .
But they do send a message to boys , that they are not , the boys are not really the target audience .
They are doing a phenomen@@ al job of teaching girls how to def@@ end against the patri@@ arch@@ y , but they are not necessarily showing boys how they &apos;re supposed to def@@ end against the patri@@ arch@@ y .
There &apos;s no models for them .
And we also have some terri@@ fic women who are writing new stories for our kids , and as three-@@ dimensional and deli@@ ght@@ ful as Her@@ mi@@ one and K@@ at@@ n@@ is@@ s are , these are still war movies .
And , of course , the most successful studio of all time contin@@ ues to cr@@ ank out classi@@ c after classi@@ c , every single one of them about the journey of a boy , or a man , or two men who are friends , or a man and his son , or two men who are rais@@ ing a little girl .
Un@@ til , as many of you are thinking , this year , when they finally came out with &quot; Br@@ ave . &quot;
I re@@ comm@@ end it to all of you . It &apos;s on demand now .
Do you remember what the cri@@ tics said when &quot; Br@@ ave &quot; came out ?
&quot; A@@ w , I can &apos;t believe Pi@@ x@@ ar made a pr@@ inc@@ ess movie . &quot;
It &apos;s very good . Don &apos;t let that stop you .
Now , almost none of these movies pass the Be@@ ch@@ del T@@ est .
I don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve heard of this .
It has not yet caught on and caught fire , but maybe today we will start a movement .
Al@@ ison Be@@ ch@@ del is a com@@ ic book artist , and back in the mid@@ - &apos; 8@@ 0s , she recor@@ ded this conversation she &apos;d had with a friend about ass@@ essing the movies that they saw .
And it &apos;s very simple . There &apos;s just three questions you should ask : Is there more than one character in the movie that is female who has lines ?
So try to meet that bar .
And do these women talk to each other at any point in the movie ?
And is their conversation about something other than the guy that they both like ? Right ? Thank you . Thank you very much .
Two women who exist and talk to each other about stuff .
It does happen . I &apos;ve seen it , and yet I very rar@@ ely see it in the movies that we know and love .
In fact , this week I went to see a very high-@@ quality movie , &quot; Ar@@ go . &quot;
Right ? O@@ sc@@ ar bu@@ z@@ z , doing great at the box office , a con@@ sen@@ sus idea of what a quality Hollywood film is .
It pretty much fl@@ un@@ ks the Be@@ ch@@ del test .
And I don &apos;t think it should , because a lot of the movie , I don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve seen it , but a lot of the movie takes place in this emb@@ ass@@ y where men and women are hi@@ ding out during the ho@@ stage crisis .
We &apos;ve got quite a few scen@@ es of the men having deep , ang@@ st-@@ ri@@ dden conversations in this hi@@ de@@ out , and the great moment for one of the ac@@ tr@@ esses is to pe@@ ek through the door and say , &quot; Are you coming to bed , hon@@ ey ? &quot;
That &apos;s Hollywood for you .
So let &apos;s look at the numbers .
2011 , of the 100 most popular movies , how many of them do you think actually have female prot@@ ag@@ on@@ ists ?
El@@ even . It &apos;s not bad .
It &apos;s not as many percent as the number of women we &apos;ve just elec@@ ted to Congr@@ ess , so that &apos;s good .
But there is a number that is greater than this that &apos;s going to bring this room down .
Last year , The New York Times published a study that the government had done .
Here &apos;s what it said .
One out of five women in America say that they have been sexu@@ ally ass@@ au@@ l@@ ted some time in their life .
Now , I don &apos;t think that &apos;s the fau@@ lt of popular entert@@ ain@@ ment .
I don &apos;t think kids &apos; movies have anything to do with that .
I don &apos;t even think that music videos or por@@ no@@ graph@@ y are really directly related to that , but something is going wrong , and when I hear that stati@@ stic , one of the things I think of is that &apos;s a lot of sexual ass@@ ail@@ ants .
Who are these guys ? What are they learning ?
What are they fai@@ ling to learn ?
Are they absor@@ bing the story that a male her@@ o &apos;s job is to de@@ fe@@ at the vill@@ ain with violence and then collect the re@@ ward , which is a woman who has no friends and doesn &apos;t speak ?
Are we so@@ aking up that story ?
You know , as a parent with the privil@@ e@@ ge of rais@@ ing a daughter like all of you who are doing the same thing , we find this world and this stati@@ stic very al@@ arm@@ ing and we want to pre@@ pare them .
We have tools at our dispos@@ al like &quot; girl power , &quot; and we hope that that will help , but I got@@ ta wonder , is girl power going to protect them if , at the same time , activ@@ ely or pas@@ sively , we are training our sons to ma@@ intain their boy power ?
I mean , I think the N@@ et@@ fli@@ x queue is one way that we can do something very important , and I &apos;m talking main@@ ly to the d@@ ads here .
I think we have got to show our sons a new definition of man@@ hood .
The definition of man@@ hood is already turning up@@ side down .
You &apos;ve read about how the new economy is changing the ro@@ les of care@@ gi@@ ver and w@@ age ear@@ ner .
They &apos;re thro@@ wing it up in the air .
So our sons are going to have to find some way of adap@@ ting to this , some new relationship with each other , and I think we really have to show them , and model for them , how a real man is someone who tr@@ us@@ ts his s@@ is@@ ters and resp@@ ects them , and wants to be on their team , and st@@ ands up against the real bad guys , who are the men who want to ab@@ use the women .
And I think our job in the N@@ et@@ fli@@ x queue is to look out for those movies that pass the Be@@ ch@@ del T@@ est , if we can find them , and to see@@ k out the her@@ o@@ ines who are there , who show real courage , who bring people together , and to nu@@ dge our sons to identify with those her@@ o@@ ines and to say , &quot; I want to be on their team , &quot; because they &apos;re going to be on their team .
When I asked my daughter who her favorite character was in &quot; St@@ ar W@@ ars , &quot; do you know what she said ?
O@@ bi@@ -@@ W@@ an .
O@@ bi@@ -@@ W@@ an Ken@@ ob@@ i and Gl@@ ind@@ a .
What do these two have in common ?
Maybe it &apos;s not just the s@@ par@@ kly d@@ ress .
I think these people are experts .
I think these are the two people in the movie who know more than anybody else , and they love sharing their knowledge with other people to help them reach their potential .
Now , they are leaders .
I like that kind of qu@@ est for my daughter , and I like that kind of qu@@ est for my son .
I want more ques@@ ts like that .
I want fe@@ wer ques@@ ts where my son is told , &quot; Go out and fight it alone , &quot; and more ques@@ ts where he sees that it &apos;s his job to join a team , maybe a team led by women , to help other people become better and be better people , like the W@@ iz@@ ard of O@@ z .
Thank you .
When I was a child growing up in M@@ aine , one of my favorite things to do was to look for sand dollars on the se@@ as@@ hor@@ es of M@@ aine , because my parents told me it would bring me lu@@ ck .
But you know , these shel@@ ls , they &apos;re hard to find .
They &apos;re covered in sand , they &apos;re difficult to see .
However , over time , I got used to looking for them .
I started seeing shapes and patterns that helped me to collect them .
This grew into a passion for finding things , a love for the past and ar@@ cha@@ e@@ ology .
And eventually , when I started studying Egyp@@ to@@ logy , I realized that seeing with my n@@ a@@ ked eyes alone wasn &apos;t enough .
Because all of the sudden , in Egy@@ pt , my be@@ ach had grown from a tiny be@@ ach in M@@ aine to one eight hundred miles long , next to the N@@ ile .
And my sand dollars had grown to the size of cities .
This is really what brought me to using satellite imag@@ ery .
For trying to map the past , I knew that I had to see differently .
So I want to show you an example of how we see differently using the infr@@ ar@@ ed .
This is a site loc@@ ated in the eas@@ tern Egyp@@ tian del@@ ta called M@@ en@@ des .
And the site visi@@ bly appe@@ ars bro@@ wn , but when we use the infr@@ ar@@ ed and we process it , all of the sudden , using fal@@ se color , the site appe@@ ars as bright p@@ ink .
What you are seeing are the actual chemical changes to the landscape caused by the building materials and acti@@ vi@@ ties of the ancient Egyp@@ ti@@ ans .
What I want to share with you today is how we &apos;ve used satellite data to find an ancient Egyp@@ tian city , called I@@ t@@ j@@ ta@@ w@@ y , missing for thousands of years .
I@@ t@@ j@@ ta@@ w@@ y was ancient Egy@@ pt &apos;s capital for over four hundred years , at a period of time called the Middle K@@ ing@@ dom , about four thousand years ago .
The site is loc@@ ated in the Fai@@ y@@ um of Egy@@ pt , and the site is really important , because in the Middle K@@ ing@@ dom there was this great ren@@ aiss@@ ance for ancient Egyp@@ tian art , architecture and religion .
Egyp@@ to@@ logists have always known the site of I@@ t@@ j@@ ta@@ w@@ y was loc@@ ated somewhere near the pyram@@ ids of the two k@@ ings who built it , indic@@ ated within the red cir@@ cles here , but somewhere within this massive f@@ loo@@ d pl@@ ain .
This area is huge -- it &apos;s four miles by three miles in size .
The N@@ ile used to flow right next to the city of I@@ t@@ j@@ ta@@ w@@ y , and as it shif@@ ted and changed and moved over time to the e@@ ast , it covered over the city .
So , how do you find a bu@@ ried city in a vast landscape ?
Fin@@ ding it rand@@ om@@ ly would be the equivalent of loc@@ ating a nee@@ dle in a h@@ ay@@ st@@ ack , bl@@ ind@@ fol@@ ded , wearing baseball mit@@ ts .
So what we did is we used NASA to@@ po@@ graph@@ y data to map out the landscape , very sub@@ tle changes .
We started to be able to see where the N@@ ile used to flow .
But you can see in more detail , and even more interesting , this very s@@ light raised area seen within the circle up here which we thought could possibly be the location of the city of I@@ t@@ j@@ ta@@ w@@ y .
So we collabor@@ ated with Egyp@@ tian scientists to do cor@@ ing work , which you see here .
When I say cor@@ ing , it &apos;s like ice cor@@ ing , but instead of lay@@ ers of climate change , you &apos;re looking for lay@@ ers of human occup@@ ation .
And , five meters down , underneath a th@@ ick layer of mu@@ d , we found a dense layer of po@@ t@@ tery .
What this shows is that at this possible location of I@@ t@@ j@@ ta@@ w@@ y , five meters down , we have a layer of occup@@ ation for several hundred years , d@@ ating to the Middle K@@ ing@@ dom , d@@ ating to the exact period of time we think I@@ t@@ j@@ ta@@ w@@ y is .
We also found work stone -- car@@ n@@ eli@@ an , quar@@ t@@ z and ag@@ ate that shows that there was a je@@ wel@@ er &apos;s work@@ shop here .
These might not look like much , but when you think about the most common st@@ ones used in je@@ wel@@ ry from the Middle K@@ ing@@ dom , these are the st@@ ones that were used .
So , we have a dense layer of occup@@ ation d@@ ating to the Middle K@@ ing@@ dom at this site .
We also have evidence of an el@@ ite je@@ wel@@ er &apos;s work@@ shop , showing that whatever was there was a very important city .
No I@@ t@@ j@@ ta@@ w@@ y was here yet , but we &apos;re going to be re@@ turning to the site in the near future to map it out .
And even more importantly , we have funding to train young Egyp@@ ti@@ ans in the use of satellite technology so they can be the ones making great disco@@ ver@@ ies as well .
So I wanted to end with my favorite quote from the Middle K@@ ing@@ dom -- it was probably written at the city of I@@ t@@ j@@ ta@@ w@@ y four thousand years ago .
&quot; S@@ har@@ ing knowledge is the greatest of all call@@ ings .
There &apos;s nothing like it in the land . &quot;
So as it turns out , TED was not f@@ ounded in 198@@ 4 A@@ D .
Ma@@ king ideas actually started in 198@@ 4 BC at a not@@ -@@ lo@@ st-@@ for@@ -@@ long city , found from above .
It certainly puts finding se@@ as@@ hel@@ ls by the se@@ as@@ hore in perspective .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
I &apos;d like to invite you to close your eyes .
Imagine yourself standing outside the front door of your home .
I &apos;d like you to notice the color of the door , the material that it &apos;s made out of .
Now visu@@ alize a p@@ ack of over@@ weight nu@@ dis@@ ts on bic@@ y@@ cles .
They are comp@@ eting in a n@@ a@@ ked bic@@ y@@ cle race , and they are hea@@ ded straight for your front door .
I need you to actually see this .
They are pe@@ d@@ aling really hard , they &apos;re swe@@ at@@ y , they &apos;re b@@ ounc@@ ing around a lot .
And they cr@@ ash straight into the front door of your home .
B@@ ic@@ y@@ cles fly everywhere , whe@@ els roll past you , spo@@ kes end up in aw@@ k@@ ward places .
Ste@@ p over the th@@ res@@ hold of your door into your fo@@ yer , your h@@ all@@ way , whatever &apos;s on the other side , and appreci@@ ate the quality of the light .
The light is sh@@ in@@ ing down on C@@ oo@@ k@@ ie Mon@@ ster .
C@@ oo@@ k@@ ie Mon@@ ster is w@@ aving at you from his per@@ ch on top of a t@@ an hor@@ se .
It &apos;s a talking hor@@ se .
You can prac@@ tically feel his blue fur tic@@ k@@ ling your no@@ se .
You can smell the o@@ at@@ me@@ al rais@@ in co@@ ok@@ ie that he &apos;s about to sho@@ v@@ el into his mouth .
W@@ alk past him into your living room .
In your living room , in full imagin@@ ative broad@@ band , picture Brit@@ ney S@@ pe@@ ars .
She is sc@@ anti@@ ly cl@@ ad , she &apos;s d@@ ancing on your coffee table , and she &apos;s sing@@ ing &quot; H@@ it M@@ e Bab@@ y One More Ti@@ me . &quot;
And then , follow me into your kitch@@ en .
In your kitch@@ en , the floor has been p@@ av@@ ed over with a yellow bri@@ ck road , and out of your o@@ ven are coming towards you D@@ or@@ o@@ thy , the T@@ in Man , the S@@ car@@ ec@@ row and the L@@ ion from &quot; The W@@ iz@@ ard of O@@ z , &quot; hand@@ -@@ in-@@ hand , ski@@ pping straight towards you .
Okay . O@@ pen your eyes .
I want to tell you about a very bizarre cont@@ est that is held every spring in New York City .
It &apos;s called the United States M@@ em@@ ory Ch@@ am@@ pi@@ on@@ ship .
And I had gone to cover this cont@@ est a few years back as a science journalis@@ t , exp@@ ecting , I guess , that this was going to be like the Su@@ per@@ bo@@ w@@ l of sav@@ ants .
This was a bunch of guys and a few la@@ dies , wid@@ ely v@@ ar@@ ying in both age and hy@@ gi@@ en@@ ic up@@ keep .
They were mem@@ or@@ izing hundreds of random numbers , looking at them just once .
They were mem@@ or@@ izing the names of do@@ z@@ ens and do@@ z@@ ens and do@@ z@@ ens of str@@ angers .
They were mem@@ or@@ izing entire po@@ ems in just a few minutes .
They were comp@@ eting to see who could mem@@ or@@ ize the order of a shu@@ ff@@ led p@@ ack of playing cards the fas@@ test .
I was like , this is un@@ believ@@ able .
These people must be fre@@ a@@ ks of nature .
And I started talking to a few of the competi@@ tors .
This is a guy called E@@ d Co@@ ok , who had come over from England , where he had one of the bes@@ t-@@ trained mem@@ ories .
And I said to him , &quot; E@@ d , when did you realize that you were a s@@ av@@ ant ? &quot;
And E@@ d was like , &quot; I &apos;m not a s@@ av@@ ant .
In fact , I have just an average memory .
Everybody who comp@@ et@@ es in this cont@@ est will tell you that they have just an average memory .
We &apos;ve all trained ourselves to perform these ut@@ ter@@ ly mirac@@ ul@@ ous fe@@ ats of memory using a set of ancient techniques , techniques invented 2,@@ 500 years ago in Gre@@ e@@ ce , the same techniques that C@@ ic@@ er@@ o had used to mem@@ or@@ ize his spe@@ e@@ ches , that medi@@ ev@@ al sch@@ ol@@ ars had used to mem@@ or@@ ize entire books . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Wh@@ o@@ a . How come I never heard of this before ? &quot;
And we were standing outside the competition h@@ all , and E@@ d , who is a wonderful , brilliant , but some@@ what ec@@ cen@@ tric English guy , says to me , &quot; J@@ os@@ h , you &apos;re an American journalis@@ t .
Do you know Brit@@ ney S@@ pe@@ ars ? &quot;
I &apos;m like , &quot; What ? No . Why ? &quot;
&quot; Because I really want to teach Brit@@ ney S@@ pe@@ ars how to mem@@ or@@ ize the order of a shu@@ ff@@ led p@@ ack of playing cards on U.S. national television .
It will prove to the world that anybody can do this . &quot;
I was like , &quot; Well , I &apos;m not Brit@@ ney S@@ pe@@ ars , but maybe you could teach me .
I mean , you &apos;ve got to start somewhere , right ? &quot;
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me .
I ended up spending the better part of the next year not only training my memory , but also investig@@ ating it , trying to understand how it works , why it sometimes doesn &apos;t work , and what its potential might be .
And I met a ho@@ st of really interesting people .
This is a guy called E@@ .@@ P .
He &apos;s an am@@ n@@ es@@ ic who had , very possibly , the worst memory in the world .
His memory was so bad , that he didn &apos;t even remember he had a memory problem , which is amazing .
And he was this incredibly trag@@ ic figure , but he was a window into the ex@@ tent to which our mem@@ ories make us who we are .
At the other end of the spectrum , I met this guy .
This is K@@ im Pe@@ ek , he was the basis for D@@ us@@ tin H@@ off@@ man &apos;s character in the movie &quot; R@@ ain Man . &quot;
We spent an after@@ no@@ on together in the Sal@@ t L@@ ake City Public Li@@ br@@ ary mem@@ or@@ izing phone books , which was sc@@ in@@ till@@ ating .
And I went back and I read a whole ho@@ st of memory tre@@ ati@@ ses , tre@@ ati@@ ses written 2,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ plus years ago in L@@ atin , in anti@@ qu@@ ity , and then later , in the Middle A@@ ges .
And I learned a whole bunch of really interesting stuff .
One of the really interesting things that I learned is that once upon a time , this idea of having a trained , discipl@@ ined , cul@@ tiv@@ ated memory was not nearly so alien as it would seem to us to be today .
Once upon a time , people inv@@ ested in their mem@@ ories , in labor@@ i@@ ously fur@@ n@@ ishing their minds .
Over the last few mill@@ en@@ ia , we &apos;ve invented a series of technologies -- from the alph@@ ab@@ et , to the s@@ cro@@ ll , to the co@@ de@@ x , the printing press , photograph@@ y , the computer , the smart@@ phone -- that have made it progr@@ essi@@ vely easier and easier for us to ex@@ tern@@ alize our mem@@ ories , for us to essentially out@@ source this fundamental human capacity .
These technologies have made our modern world possible , but they &apos;ve also changed us .
They &apos;ve changed us cul@@ tur@@ ally , and I would argue that they &apos;ve changed us cogni@@ tively .
H@@ aving little need to remember anymore , it sometimes seems like we &apos;ve for@@ gotten how .
One of the last places on Earth where you still find people passionate about this idea of a trained , discipl@@ ined , cul@@ tiv@@ ated memory , is at this totally sing@@ ular memory cont@@ est .
It &apos;s actually not that sing@@ ular , there are cont@@ ests held all over the world .
And I was fascin@@ ated , I wanted to know how do these guys do it .
A few years back a group of researchers at University Col@@ le@@ ge London brought a bunch of memory champi@@ ons into the lab .
They wanted to know : Do these guys have brains that are somehow struc@@ tur@@ ally , an@@ atom@@ ically different from the rest of ours ?
The answer was no .
Are they smar@@ ter than the rest of us ?
They gave them a bunch of cognitive tests , and the answer was : not really .
There was , how@@ ever , one really interesting and telling difference between the brains of the memory champi@@ ons and the control subj@@ ects that they were compar@@ ing them to .
When they put these guys in an f@@ M@@ R@@ I machine , scann@@ ed their brains while they were mem@@ or@@ izing numbers they found that the memory champi@@ ons were li@@ ghting up different parts of the brain than everyone else .
Of note , they were using , or they seemed to be using , a part of the brain that &apos;s involved in spatial memory and navig@@ ation .
Why ? And is there something that the rest of us can learn from this ?
The sport of competi@@ tive mem@@ or@@ izing is driven by a kind of arms race where , every year , somebody comes up with a new way to remember more stuff more quickly , and then the rest of the field has to play cat@@ ch@@ -up .
This is my friend Ben Pri@@ d@@ more , three-@@ time world memory champi@@ on .
On his des@@ k in front of him are 3@@ 6 shu@@ ff@@ led p@@ acks of playing cards that he is about to try to mem@@ or@@ ize in one hour , using a technique that he invented and he alone has mas@@ tered .
He used a similar technique to mem@@ or@@ ize the pre@@ c@@ ise order of 4@@ ,@@ 1@@ 40 random bin@@ ary dig@@ its in half an hour .
Yeah .
And while there are a whole ho@@ st of ways of rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ing stuff in these competi@@ tions , everything , all of the techniques that are being used , ultimately come down to a concept that psycho@@ logists re@@ fer to as &quot; el@@ abor@@ ative en@@ co@@ ding . &quot;
And it &apos;s well-@@ illustr@@ ated by a ni@@ f@@ ty parado@@ x known as the B@@ ak@@ er / b@@ ak@@ er parado@@ x , which goes like this : If I tell two people to remember the same word , if I say to you , &quot; Rem@@ ember that there is a guy named B@@ ak@@ er . &quot;
That &apos;s his name .
And I say to you , &quot; Rem@@ ember that there is a guy who is a b@@ ak@@ er . &quot;
And I come back to you at some point later on , and I say , &quot; Do you remember that word that I told you a while back ?
Do you remember what it was ? &quot;
The person who was told his name is B@@ ak@@ er is less likely to remember the same word than the person was told his job is a b@@ ak@@ er .
S@@ ame word , different amount of rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ing ; that &apos;s weird .
What &apos;s going on here ?
Well , the name B@@ ak@@ er doesn &apos;t actually mean anything to you .
It is entirely un@@ te@@ ther@@ ed from all of the other mem@@ ories flo@@ ating around in your sk@@ ull .
But the common nou@@ n &quot; b@@ ak@@ er &quot; -- we know b@@ ak@@ ers .
B@@ ak@@ ers wear funny white h@@ ats .
B@@ ak@@ ers have fl@@ our on their hands .
B@@ ak@@ ers smell good when they come home from work .
Maybe we even know a b@@ ak@@ er .
And when we first hear that word , we start putting these associ@@ ational ho@@ o@@ ks into it , that make it easier to fish it back out at some later date .
The entire art of what is going on in these memory cont@@ ests , and the entire art of rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ing stuff better in everyday life , is figu@@ ring out ways to transform capital B B@@ ak@@ ers into lo@@ wer@@ -@@ case B b@@ ak@@ ers -- to take information that is l@@ acking in context , in signific@@ ance , in meaning , and transform it in some way , so that it becomes meaning@@ ful in the light of all the other things that you have in your mind .
One of the more el@@ abor@@ ate techniques for doing this dat@@ es back 2,@@ 500 years to An@@ ci@@ ent Gre@@ e@@ ce .
It came to be known as the memory pal@@ ace .
The story behind its creation goes like this : There was a po@@ et called Sim@@ on@@ ides , who was attend@@ ing a ban@@ qu@@ et .
He was actually the hi@@ red entert@@ ain@@ ment , because back then , if you wanted to throw a really s@@ lam@@ ming party , you didn &apos;t h@@ ire a D@@ .@@ J@@ . , you hi@@ red a po@@ et .
And he st@@ ands up , deli@@ vers his poem from memory , wal@@ ks out the door , and at the moment he does , the ban@@ qu@@ et h@@ all collap@@ ses .
K@@ ills everybody inside .
It doesn &apos;t just kill everybody , it mang@@ les the bodies beyond all recogni@@ tion .
No@@ body can say who was inside , nobody can say where they were sitting .
The bodies can &apos;t be proper@@ ly bu@@ ried .
It &apos;s one tr@@ age@@ dy com@@ pou@@ n@@ ding another .
Sim@@ on@@ ides , standing outside , the so@@ le surviv@@ or am@@ id the w@@ rec@@ k@@ age , clo@@ ses his eyes and has this realiz@@ ation , which is that in his mind &apos;s eye , he can see where each of the gu@@ ests at the ban@@ qu@@ et had been sitting .
And he takes the rel@@ atives by the hand , and gu@@ ides them each to their loved ones am@@ id the w@@ rec@@ k@@ age .
What Sim@@ on@@ ides figured out at that moment , is something that I think we all kind of intu@@ i@@ tively know , which is that , as bad as we are at rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ing names and phone numbers , and wor@@ d-@@ for@@ -@@ word instructions from our colleagues , we have really excep@@ tional visual and spatial mem@@ ories .
If I asked you to re@@ count the first 10 words of the story that I just told you about Sim@@ on@@ ides , chances are you would have a tough time with it .
But , I would w@@ ager that if I asked you to rec@@ all who is sitting on top of a talking t@@ an hor@@ se in your fo@@ yer right now , you would be able to see that .
The idea behind the memory pal@@ ace is to create this imagin@@ ed e@@ di@@ fice in your mind &apos;s eye , and popul@@ ate it with images of the things that you want to remember -- the craz@@ ier , we@@ ir@@ der , more bizarre , fun@@ ni@@ er , r@@ au@@ n@@ chi@@ er , st@@ in@@ ki@@ er the image is , the more un@@ for@@ get@@ table it &apos;s likely to be .
This is ad@@ vice that goes back 2,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ plus years to the ear@@ li@@ est L@@ atin memory tre@@ ati@@ ses .
So how does this work ?
Let &apos;s say that you &apos;ve been invited to TED center stage to give a speech , and you want to do it from memory , and you want to do it the way that C@@ ic@@ er@@ o would have done it , if he had been invited to TED@@ x@@ Rome 2,000 years ago .
What you might do is picture yourself at the front door of your house .
And you &apos;d come up with some sort of crazy , ridi@@ cul@@ ous , un@@ for@@ get@@ table image , to re@@ mind you that the first thing you want to talk about is this totally bizarre cont@@ est .
And then you &apos;d go inside your house , and you would see an image of C@@ oo@@ k@@ ie Mon@@ ster on top of M@@ ister E@@ d .
And that would re@@ mind you that you would want to then introduce your friend E@@ d Co@@ ok .
And then you &apos;d see an image of Brit@@ ney S@@ pe@@ ars to re@@ mind you of this funny an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote you want to tell .
And you &apos;d go into your kitch@@ en , and the fourth top@@ ic you were going to talk about was this strange journey that you went on for a year , and you &apos;d have some friends to help you remember that .
This is how Rom@@ an or@@ ators mem@@ or@@ ized their spe@@ e@@ ches -- not wor@@ d-@@ for@@ -@@ word , which is just going to scre@@ w you up , but top@@ ic@@ -@@ for@@ -@@ top@@ ic .
In fact , the phrase &quot; top@@ ic sentence &quot; -- that comes from the Gre@@ ek word &quot; to@@ pos , &quot; which means &quot; place . &quot;
That &apos;s a v@@ esti@@ ge of when people used to think about or@@ atory and r@@ h@@ et@@ or@@ ic in these sorts of spatial terms .
The phrase &quot; in the first place , &quot; that &apos;s like &quot; in the first place of your memory pal@@ ace . &quot;
I thought this was just fascinating , and I got really into it .
And I went to a few more of these memory cont@@ ests , and I had this notion that I might write something longer about this sub@@ culture of competi@@ tive mem@@ or@@ iz@@ ers .
But there was a problem .
The problem was that a memory cont@@ est is a patho@@ log@@ ically bor@@ ing event .
Tr@@ u@@ ly , it is like a bunch of people sitting around taking the S@@ A@@ T@@ s -- I mean , the most dram@@ atic it gets is when somebody starts m@@ ass@@ aging their temp@@ les .
And I &apos;m a journalis@@ t , I need something to write about .
I know that there &apos;s incredible stuff happening in these people &apos;s minds , but I don &apos;t have access to it .
And I realized , if I was going to tell this story , I needed to walk in their shoes a little bit .
And so I started trying to spend 15 or 20 minutes every morning , before I sat down with my New York Times , just trying to remember something .
Maybe it was a poem , maybe it was names from an old year@@ book that I bought at a fle@@ a market .
And I found that this was shoc@@ k@@ ingly fun .
I never would have expected that .
It was fun because this is actually not about training your memory .
What you &apos;re doing , is you &apos;re trying to get better and better at creating , at dre@@ aming up , these ut@@ ter@@ ly lu@@ di@@ cr@@ ous , r@@ au@@ n@@ ch@@ y , h@@ il@@ ari@@ ous , and hopefully un@@ for@@ get@@ table images in your mind &apos;s eye .
And I got pretty into it .
This is me wearing my standard competi@@ tive mem@@ or@@ iz@@ er &apos;s training k@@ it .
It &apos;s a pair of ear@@ mu@@ ff@@ s and a set of safety go@@ gg@@ les that have been mas@@ ked over except for two small pin@@ holes , because distr@@ action is the competi@@ tive mem@@ or@@ iz@@ er &apos;s greatest enem@@ y .
I ended up coming back to that same cont@@ est that I had covered a year earlier , and I had this notion that I might enter it , sort of as an experiment in particip@@ atory journalis@@ m .
It &apos;d make , I thought , maybe a nice e@@ pil@@ o@@ gue to all my research .
P@@ rob@@ lem was , the experiment went h@@ ay@@ w@@ ire .
I won the cont@@ est -- which really wasn &apos;t supposed to happen .
Now , it is nice to be able to mem@@ or@@ ize spe@@ e@@ ches and phone numbers and sh@@ op@@ ping l@@ ists , but it &apos;s actually kind of bes@@ ide the point .
These are just tric@@ ks .
They work because they &apos;re based on some pretty basic principles about how our brains work .
And you don &apos;t have to be building memory pal@@ aces or mem@@ or@@ izing p@@ acks of playing cards to benefit from a little bit of insi@@ ght about how your mind works .
We often talk about people with great mem@@ ories as though it were some sort of an in@@ n@@ ate gi@@ ft , but that is not the case .
Great mem@@ ories are learned .
At the most basic level , we remember when we pay attention .
We remember when we are deeply engaged .
We remember when we are able to take a piece of information and experience , and figure out why it is meaning@@ ful to us , why it is significant , why it &apos;s color@@ ful , when we &apos;re able to transform it in some way that makes sense in the light of all of the other things flo@@ ating around in our minds , when we &apos;re able to transform B@@ ak@@ ers into b@@ ak@@ ers .
The memory pal@@ ace , these memory techniques -- they &apos;re just shor@@ t@@ cu@@ ts .
In fact , they &apos;re not even really shor@@ t@@ cu@@ ts .
They work because they make you work .
They force a kind of de@@ p@@ th of proc@@ essing , a kind of min@@ d@@ ful@@ ness , that most of us don &apos;t normally walk around exer@@ cis@@ ing .
But there actually are no shor@@ t@@ cu@@ ts .
This is how stuff is made mem@@ or@@ able .
And I think if there &apos;s one thing that I want to leave you with , it &apos;s what E@@ .@@ P@@ . , the am@@ n@@ es@@ ic who couldn &apos;t even remember he had a memory problem , left me with , which is the notion that our lives are the sum of our mem@@ ories .
How much are we willing to lose from our already short lives , by losing ourselves in our Bl@@ ack@@ ber@@ ries , our iPh@@ ones , by not paying attention to the human being across from us who is talking with us , by being so la@@ z@@ y that we &apos;re not willing to process deeply ?
I learned fir@@ s@@ th@@ and that there are incredible memory capac@@ i@@ ties lat@@ ent in all of us .
But if you want to live a mem@@ or@@ able life , you have to be the kind of person who rem@@ em@@ bers to remember .
Thank you .
Today I &apos;m going to speak to you about the last 30 years of architec@@ tural history .
That &apos;s a lot to p@@ ack into 18 minutes .
It &apos;s a complex top@@ ic , so we &apos;re just going to di@@ ve right in at a complex place : New Jer@@ sey .
Because 30 years ago , I &apos;m from Jer@@ sey , and I was six , and I lived there in my parents &apos; house in a town called L@@ iv@@ ing@@ ston , and this was my childhood be@@ dro@@ om .
Ar@@ ound the corner from my be@@ dro@@ om was the b@@ ath@@ room that I used to share with my sister .
And in between my be@@ dro@@ om and the b@@ ath@@ room was a bal@@ con@@ y that over@@ looked the family room .
And that &apos;s where everyone would han@@ g out and watch TV , so that every time that I walked from my be@@ dro@@ om to the b@@ ath@@ room , everyone would see me , and every time I took a sho@@ wer and would come back in a to@@ w@@ el , everyone would see me .
And I looked like this .
I was aw@@ k@@ ward , insec@@ ure , and I h@@ ated it .
I h@@ ated that walk , I h@@ ated that bal@@ con@@ y , I h@@ ated that room , and I h@@ ated that house .
And that &apos;s architecture .
D@@ one .
That feeling , those emotions that I felt , that &apos;s the power of architecture , because architecture is not about math and it &apos;s not about z@@ oning , it &apos;s about those vis@@ cer@@ al , emotional connections that we feel to the places that we occup@@ y .
And it &apos;s no surprise that we feel that way , because according to the E@@ PA , Americans spend 90 percent of their time in@@ do@@ ors .
That &apos;s 90 percent of our time surr@@ ounded by architecture .
That &apos;s huge .
That means that architecture is shap@@ ing us in ways that we didn &apos;t even realize .
That makes us a little bit g@@ ul@@ li@@ ble and very , very predic@@ table .
It means that when I show you a building like this , I know what you think : You think &quot; power &quot; and &quot; st@@ ability &quot; and &quot; democracy . &quot;
And I know you think that because it &apos;s based on a building that was build 2,@@ 500 years ago by the Gre@@ e@@ ks .
This is a trick .
This is a tr@@ ig@@ ger that archit@@ ects use to get you to create an emotional connection to the forms that we build our buildings out of .
It &apos;s a predic@@ table emotional connection , and we &apos;ve been using this trick for a long , long time .
We used it &#91; 200 &#93; years ago to build ban@@ ks .
We used it in the 19@@ th century to build art mus@@ eu@@ ms .
And in the 20th century in America , we used it to build houses .
And look at these soli@@ d , stable little soldiers facing the ocean and keeping away the elements .
This is really , really useful , because building things is terri@@ fying .
It &apos;s expensive , it takes a long time , and it &apos;s very complicated .
And the people that build things -- develop@@ ers and governments -- they &apos;re natur@@ ally afraid of innovation , and they &apos;d rather just use those forms that they know you &apos;ll respond to .
That &apos;s how we end up with buildings like this .
This is a nice building .
This is the L@@ iv@@ ing@@ ston Public Li@@ br@@ ary that was complet@@ ed in 2004 in my hom@@ et@@ own , and , you know , it &apos;s got a dom@@ e and it &apos;s got this round thing and col@@ um@@ ns , red bri@@ ck , and you can kind of guess what L@@ iv@@ ing@@ ston is trying to say with this building : children , property values and history .
But it doesn &apos;t have much to do with what a libr@@ ary actually does today .
That same year , in 2004 , on the other side of the country , another libr@@ ary was complet@@ ed , and it looks like this .
It &apos;s in Se@@ at@@ tle .
This libr@@ ary is about how we consu@@ me media in a digital age .
It &apos;s about a new kind of public amen@@ ity for the city , a place to ga@@ ther and read and share .
So how is it possible that in the same year , in the same country , two buildings , both called libr@@ aries , look so completely different ?
And the answer is that architecture works on the principle of a pend@@ ul@@ um .
On the one side is innovation , and archit@@ ects are constantly push@@ ing , push@@ ing for new technologies , new ty@@ po@@ logi@@ es , new solutions for the way that we live today .
And we push and we push and we push until we completely ali@@ en@@ ate all of you .
We wear all black , we get very de@@ pressed , you think we &apos;re ador@@ able , we &apos;re dead inside because we &apos;ve got no choice .
We have to go to the other side and re@@ engage those sym@@ b@@ ols that we know you love .
So we do that , and you &apos;re happy , we feel like sel@@ lou@@ ts , so we start experim@@ enting again and we push the pend@@ ul@@ um back and back and forth and back and forth we &apos;ve gone for the last 300 years , and certainly for the last 30 years .
Okay , 30 years ago we were coming out of the &apos; 7@@ 0s .
Ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ects had been bus@@ y experim@@ enting with something called bru@@ t@@ alism .
It &apos;s about concre@@ te .
You can guess this .
Sm@@ all windo@@ ws , de@@ human@@ izing scale .
This is really tough stuff .
So as we get closer to the &apos; 8@@ 0s , we start to re@@ engage those sym@@ b@@ ols .
We push the pend@@ ul@@ um back into the other direction .
We take these forms that we know you love and we up@@ date them .
We add ne@@ on and we add pas@@ t@@ els and we use new materials .
And you love it .
And we can &apos;t give you enough of it .
We take Chi@@ p@@ pend@@ ale ar@@ mo@@ ires and we turned those into sk@@ y@@ scr@@ ap@@ ers , and sk@@ y@@ scr@@ ap@@ ers can be medi@@ ev@@ al cas@@ t@@ les made out of glass .
For@@ ms got big , forms got b@@ old and color@@ ful .
D@@ war@@ ves became col@@ um@@ ns .
S@@ w@@ ans grew to the size of buildings .
It was crazy .
But it &apos;s the &apos; 8@@ 0s , it &apos;s cool .
We &apos;re all h@@ ang@@ ing out in m@@ alls and we &apos;re all moving to the su@@ bur@@ bs , and out there , out in the su@@ bur@@ bs , we can create our own architec@@ tural fantas@@ ies .
And those fantas@@ ies , they can be M@@ ed@@ iter@@ ran@@ e@@ an or French or Ital@@ ian .
P@@ os@@ si@@ bly with end@@ less bre@@ ad@@ stic@@ ks .
This is the thing about pos@@ t@@ moder@@ n@@ ism .
This is the thing about sym@@ b@@ ols .
They &apos;re easy , they &apos;re cheap , because instead of making places , we &apos;re making mem@@ ories of places .
Because I know , and I know all of you know , this isn &apos;t T@@ us@@ c@@ any .
This is O@@ hi@@ o .
So archit@@ ects get frustr@@ ated , and we start push@@ ing the pend@@ ul@@ um back into the other direction .
In the late &apos; 8@@ 0s and early &apos; 9@@ 0s , we start experim@@ enting with something called dec@@ on@@ struc@@ ti@@ vis@@ m .
We throw out histor@@ ical sym@@ b@@ ols , we rely on new , compu@@ ter@@ -@@ ai@@ ded design techniques , and we come up with new com@@ positions , forms cr@@ ash@@ ing into forms .
This is academ@@ ic and hea@@ dy stuff , it &apos;s super un@@ popular , we totally ali@@ en@@ ate you .
Or@@ din@@ arily , the pend@@ ul@@ um would just s@@ wing back into the other direction .
And then , something amazing happened .
In 199@@ 7 , this building opened .
This is the Gu@@ g@@ gen@@ he@@ im B@@ il@@ b@@ a@@ o , by Frank Ge@@ h@@ ry .
And this building fundament@@ ally changes the world &apos;s relationship to architecture .
Paul Gol@@ d@@ ber@@ ger said that B@@ il@@ b@@ a@@ o was one of those rare moments when cri@@ tics , academ@@ ics , and the general public were completely un@@ ited around a building .
The New York Times called this building a miracle .
T@@ our@@ ism in B@@ il@@ b@@ a@@ o increas@@ ed 2,@@ 500 percent after this building was complet@@ ed .
So all of a sudden , everybody wants one of these buildings : L@@ .@@ A. , Se@@ at@@ tle , Chicago , New York , C@@ lev@@ el@@ and , S@@ pr@@ ing@@ field .
Everybody wants one , and Ge@@ h@@ ry is everywhere .
He is our very first star@@ ch@@ it@@ ect .
Now , how is it possible that these forms -- they &apos;re wild and radical -- how is it possible that they become so u@@ bi@@ quit@@ ous throughout the world ?
And it happened because media so success@@ fully gal@@ van@@ ized around them that they quickly taught us that these forms mean culture and tour@@ ism .
We created an emotional reaction to these forms .
So did every may@@ or in the world .
So every may@@ or knew that if they had these forms , they had culture and tour@@ ism .
This phenomenon at the turn of the new mill@@ enni@@ um happened to a few other star@@ ch@@ it@@ ects .
It happened to Z@@ ah@@ a and it happened to Li@@ bes@@ kind , and what happened to these el@@ ite few archit@@ ects at the turn of the new mill@@ enni@@ um could actually start to happen to the entire field of architecture , as digital media starts to increase the speed with which we consu@@ me information .
Because think about how you consu@@ me architecture .
A thousand years ago , you would have had to have walked to the village next door to see a building .
Trans@@ port@@ ation spe@@ eds up : You can take a boat , you can take a plane , you can be a tour@@ ist .
T@@ echno@@ logy spe@@ eds up : You can see it in a newsp@@ aper , on TV , until finally , we are all architec@@ tural photograph@@ ers , and the building has become dis@@ em@@ bo@@ died from the site .
Ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ec@@ ture is everywhere now , and that means that the speed of communication has finally caught up to the speed of architecture .
Because architecture actually moves quite quickly .
It doesn &apos;t take long to think about a building .
It takes a long time to build a building , three or four years , and in the inter@@ im , an archit@@ ect will design two or eight or a hundred other buildings before they know if that building that they designed four years ago was a success or not .
That &apos;s because there &apos;s never been a good feedback loo@@ p in architecture .
That &apos;s how we end up with buildings like this .
B@@ ru@@ t@@ alism wasn &apos;t a two-@@ year movement , it was a 20@@ -@@ year movement .
For 20 years , we were producing buildings like this because we had no idea how much you h@@ ated it .
It &apos;s never going to happen again , I think , because we are living on the ver@@ ge of the greatest revolution in architecture since the invention of concre@@ te , of ste@@ el , or of the el@@ ev@@ ator , and it &apos;s a media revolution .
So my theory is that when you apply media to this pend@@ ul@@ um , it starts sw@@ inging faster and faster , until it &apos;s at both extre@@ mes nearly simul@@ tane@@ ously , and that effectively blu@@ rs the difference between innovation and symbo@@ l , between us , the archit@@ ects , and you , the public .
Now we can make nearly inst@@ antan@@ e@@ ous , emo@@ tion@@ ally charg@@ ed sym@@ b@@ ols out of something that &apos;s brand new .
Let me show you how this plays out in a project that my fir@@ m recently complet@@ ed .
We were hi@@ red to re@@ place this building , which bur@@ ned down .
This is the center of a town called the P@@ ines in F@@ ire Island in New York State .
It &apos;s a vac@@ ation community .
We pro@@ posed a building that was aud@@ aci@@ ous , that was different than any of the forms that the community was used to , and we were scar@@ ed and our client was scar@@ ed and the community was scar@@ ed , so we created a series of phot@@ ore@@ alis@@ tic rend@@ er@@ ings that we put onto Facebook and we put onto Inst@@ ag@@ ram , and we let people start to do what they do : share it , comment , like it , hate it .
But that meant that two years before the building was complete , it was already a part of the community , so that when the rend@@ er@@ ings looked exactly like the finished product , there were no sur@@ prises .
This building was already a part of this community , and then that first summer , when people started arri@@ ving and sharing the building on social media , the building ce@@ ased to be just an e@@ di@@ fice and it became media , because these , these are not just pictures of a building , they &apos;re your pictures of a building .
And as you use them to tell your story , they become part of your personal narrative , and what you &apos;re doing is you &apos;re shor@@ t-@@ circu@@ iting all of our collective memory , and you &apos;re making these charg@@ ed sym@@ b@@ ols for us to understand .
That means we don &apos;t need the Gre@@ e@@ ks anymore to tell us what to think about architecture .
We can tell each other what we think about architecture , because digital media hasn &apos;t just changed the relationship between all of us , it &apos;s changed the relationship between us and buildings .
Think for a second about those libr@@ ari@@ ans back in L@@ iv@@ ing@@ ston .
If that building was going to be built today , the first thing they would do is go online and search &quot; new libr@@ aries . &quot;
They would be bomb@@ ar@@ ded by examples of experim@@ entation , of innovation , of push@@ ing at the envelop@@ e of what a libr@@ ary can be .
That &apos;s am@@ m@@ uni@@ tion .
That &apos;s am@@ m@@ uni@@ tion that they can take with them to the may@@ or of L@@ iv@@ ing@@ ston , to the people of L@@ iv@@ ing@@ ston , and say , there &apos;s no one answer to what a libr@@ ary is today .
Let &apos;s be a part of this .
This ab@@ un@@ dance of experim@@ entation gives them the freedom to run their own experiment .
Everything is different now .
Ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ects are no longer these myst@@ er@@ ious creatures that use big words and complicated dra@@ wings , and you aren &apos;t the h@@ a@@ pl@@ ess public , the consu@@ mer that won &apos;t accept anything that they haven &apos;t seen anymore .
Ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ects can hear you , and you &apos;re not in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ated by architecture .
That means that that pend@@ ul@@ um sw@@ inging back and forth from style to style , from movement to movement , is ir@@ relevant .
We can actually move forward and find relevant solutions to the problems that our society faces .
This is the end of architec@@ tural history , and it means that the buildings of tomorrow are going to look a lot different than the buildings of today .
It means that a public space in the ancient city of S@@ ev@@ ille can be unique and t@@ ai@@ lo@@ red to the way that a modern city works .
It means that a st@@ adi@@ um in Bro@@ ok@@ ly@@ n can be a st@@ adi@@ um in Bro@@ ok@@ ly@@ n , not some re@@ d-@@ bri@@ ck histor@@ ical pas@@ ti@@ che of what we think a st@@ adi@@ um ought to be .
It means that robots are going to build our buildings , because we &apos;re finally ready for the forms that they &apos;re going to produce .
And it means that buildings will tw@@ ist to the wh@@ im@@ s of nature instead of the other way around .
It means that a parking gar@@ age in Mi@@ ami B@@ each , Fl@@ or@@ id@@ a , can also be a place for sports and for y@@ o@@ g@@ a and you can even get married there late at night .
It means that three archit@@ ects can dream about swim@@ ming in the East Ri@@ ver of New York , and then raise nearly half a million dollars from a community that gath@@ ered around their cause , no one client anymore .
It means that no building is too small for innovation , like this little re@@ in@@ de@@ er p@@ av@@ ili@@ on that &apos;s as mus@@ c@@ ly and sin@@ ew@@ y as the animals it &apos;s designed to observe .
And it means that a building doesn &apos;t have to be beautiful to be lo@@ v@@ able , like this u@@ g@@ ly little building in S@@ pain , where the archit@@ ects du@@ g a hole , p@@ acked it with h@@ ay , and then pou@@ red concre@@ te around it , and when the concre@@ te dri@@ ed , they invited someone to come and clean that h@@ ay out so that all that &apos;s left when it &apos;s done is this hi@@ de@@ ous little room that &apos;s filled with the im@@ prin@@ ts and scr@@ at@@ ches of how that place was made ,
and that becomes the most su@@ bli@@ me place to watch a S@@ pan@@ ish sun@@ set .
Because it doesn &apos;t matter if a co@@ w buil@@ ds our buildings or a robot buil@@ ds our buildings .
It doesn &apos;t matter how we build , it matters what we build .
Ar@@ ch@@ it@@ ects already know how to make buildings that are green@@ er and smar@@ ter and friend@@ lier .
We &apos;ve just been waiting for all of you to want them .
And finally , we &apos;re not on opposite sides anymore .
F@@ ind an archit@@ ect , h@@ ire an archit@@ ect , work with us to design better buildings , better cities , and a better world , because the st@@ akes are high .
Bu@@ il@@ dings don &apos;t just refl@@ ect our society , they shape our society down to the small@@ est spaces : the local libr@@ aries , the homes where we raise our children , and the walk that they take from the be@@ dro@@ om to the b@@ ath@@ room .
Thank you .
This is my ni@@ e@@ ce , St@@ el@@ la .
She &apos;s just turned one and started to walk .
And she &apos;s walking in that really cool way that one-@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds do , a kind of te@@ et@@ ering , my@@ -@@ body &apos;@@ s-@@ mo@@ v@@ ing@@ - to@@ o-@@ fas@@ t-@@ for@@ -@@ my@@ -@@ legs kind of way .
It is absolutely gor@@ ge@@ ous .
And one of her favorite things to do at the moment is to st@@ are at her@@ self in the mir@@ ror .
She absolutely lo@@ ves her refl@@ ection .
She gi@@ gg@@ les and squ@@ e@@ als , and gives her@@ self these big , w@@ et k@@ is@@ ses .
It is beautiful .
Ap@@ par@@ ently , all of her friends do this and my mom tells me that I used to do this , and it got me thinking : When did I stop doing this ?
When is it suddenly not okay to love the way that we look ?
Because appar@@ ently we don &apos;t .
T@@ en thousand people every month go@@ o@@ gle , &quot; A@@ m I u@@ g@@ ly ? &quot;
This is F@@ ay@@ e . F@@ ay@@ e is 13 and she lives in Den@@ ver .
And like any teen@@ ager , she just wants to be liked and to fit in .
It &apos;s S@@ un@@ day night .
She &apos;s getting ready for the week ahead at school .
And she &apos;s slightly dre@@ ad@@ ing it , and she &apos;s a bit conf@@ used because despite her mom telling her all the time that she &apos;s beautiful , every day at school , someone tells her that she &apos;s u@@ g@@ ly .
Because of the difference between what her mom tells her and what her friends at school , or her pe@@ ers at school are telling her , she doesn &apos;t know who to believe .
So , she takes a video of her@@ self . She pos@@ ts it to YouTube and she asks people to please leave a comment : &quot; A@@ m I pretty or am I u@@ g@@ ly ? &quot;
Well , so far , F@@ ay@@ e has received over 1@@ 3,000 comm@@ ents .
Some of them are so n@@ as@@ ty , they don &apos;t bear thinking about .
This is an average , health@@ y-@@ looking teen@@ age girl rece@@ iv@@ ing this feedback at one of the most emo@@ tion@@ ally vulnerable times in her life .
Th@@ ou@@ sands of people are pos@@ ting videos like this , mostly teen@@ age girls , reach@@ ing out in this way .
But what &apos;s leading them to do this ?
Well , today &apos;s teen@@ agers are rar@@ ely alone .
They &apos;re under pressure to be online and available at all times , talking , mess@@ aging , li@@ king , comm@@ enting , sharing , pos@@ ting — it never ends .
N@@ ever before have we been so connected , so continu@@ ously , so inst@@ antan@@ e@@ ously , so young .
And as one mom told me , it &apos;s like there &apos;s a party in their be@@ dro@@ om every night .
There &apos;s simply no priv@@ acy .
And the social pres@@ sures that go along with that are rel@@ ent@@ less .
This al@@ w@@ ay@@ s-@@ on environment is training our kids to value themselves based on the number of li@@ kes they get and the types of comm@@ ents that they rece@@ ive .
There &apos;s no separ@@ ation between online and off@@ line life .
What &apos;s real or what isn &apos;t is really hard to tell the difference between .
And it &apos;s also really hard to tell the difference between what &apos;s authenti@@ c and what &apos;s dig@@ it@@ ally manipul@@ ated .
What &apos;s a high@@ light in someone &apos;s life versus what &apos;s normal in the context of everyday .
And where are they looking to for inspiration ?
Well , you can see the kinds of images that are co@@ vering the new@@ s@@ fe@@ eds of girls today .
S@@ ize zero models still domin@@ ate our cat@@ wal@@ ks .
A@@ ir@@ br@@ ush@@ ing is now rout@@ ine .
And tr@@ ends like # thin@@ spir@@ ation , # th@@ igh@@ gap , # bi@@ kin@@ i@@ bridge and # pro@@ ana .
For those who don &apos;t know , # pro@@ ana means pro@@ -@@ an@@ ore@@ x@@ ia .
These tr@@ ends are te@@ amed with the st@@ ere@@ oty@@ ping and fl@@ ag@@ rant objec@@ ti@@ fication of women in today &apos;s popular culture .
It is not hard to see what girls are ben@@ ch@@ mar@@ king themselves against .
But boys are not imm@@ une to this either .
A@@ spir@@ ing to the ch@@ is@@ eled ja@@ w lines and ri@@ pped six p@@ acks of super@@ her@@ o-@@ like sports stars and play@@ boy music artists .
But , what &apos;s the problem with all of this ?
Well , su@@ rely we want our kids to grow up as healthy , well bal@@ anced individuals .
But in an imag@@ e-@@ obs@@ essed culture , we are training our kids to spend more time and mental effort on their appear@@ ance at the ex@@ pense of all of the other aspects of their identi@@ ties .
So , things like their relationships , the development of their physical abilities , and their studies and so on begin to suff@@ er .
S@@ ix out of 10 girls are now cho@@ os@@ ing not to do something because they don &apos;t think they look good enough .
These are not tri@@ vi@@ al acti@@ vi@@ ties .
These are fundamental acti@@ vi@@ ties to their development as humans and as contribu@@ tors to society and to the work@@ force .
Th@@ ir@@ ty@@ -@@ one percent , nearly one in three teen@@ agers , are with@@ drawing from classroom debate . They &apos;re fai@@ ling to engage in classroom debate because they don &apos;t want to draw attention to the way that they look .
One in five are not showing up to class at all on days when they don &apos;t feel good about it .
And when it comes to exam@@ s , if you don &apos;t think you look good enough , specifically if you don &apos;t think you are thin enough , you will score a lower grade point average than your pe@@ ers who are not concerned with this .
And this is consist@@ ent across Fin@@ land , the U.@@ S .
and China , and is true regard@@ less of how much you actually we@@ igh .
So to be super clear , we &apos;re talking about the way you think you look , not how you actually look .
L@@ ow body confidence is under@@ min@@ ing academ@@ ic achiev@@ ement .
But it &apos;s also dam@@ aging health .
T@@ e@@ en@@ agers with low body confidence do less physical activity , eat less fruits and veget@@ ables , par@@ take in more un@@ healthy weight control practi@@ ces that can lead to eating dis@@ orders .
They have lower self-@@ es@@ te@@ em .
They &apos;re more easily influ@@ enced by people around them and they &apos;re at greater risk of depression .
And we think it &apos;s for all of these reasons that they take more risks with things like al@@ co@@ ho@@ l and drug use ; cr@@ ash di@@ eting ; cos@@ me@@ tic surgery ; un@@ protected , earlier sex ; The pur@@ suit of the perfect body is putting pressure on our healthcare systems and co@@ sting our governments billions of dollars every year .
And we don &apos;t grow out of it .
Women who think they &apos;re over@@ weight — again , regard@@ less of whether they are or are not — have higher rates of ab@@ sent@@ e@@ e@@ ism .
S@@ ev@@ ent@@ een percent of women would not show up to a job interview on a day when they weren &apos;t feeling confi@@ dent about the way that they look .
Have a think about what this is doing to our economy .
If we could over@@ come this , what that opportunity looks like .
Un@@ loc@@ king this potential is in the interest of every single one of us .
But how do we do that ?
Well , talking , on its own , only gets you so far .
It &apos;s not enough by itself .
If you actually want to make a difference , you have to do something .
And we &apos;ve learned there are three key ways : The first is we have to educ@@ ate for body confidence .
We have to help our teen@@ agers develop strate@@ gies to over@@ come imag@@ e-@@ related pres@@ sures and build their self-@@ es@@ te@@ em .
Now , the good news is that there are many programs out there available to do this .
The bad news is that most of them don &apos;t work .
I was shoc@@ ked to learn that many well-@@ meaning programs are in@@ adver@@ t@@ ently actually making the situation worse .
So we need to make dam@@ n sure that the programs that our kids are rece@@ iv@@ ing are not only having a positive impact , but having a las@@ ting impact as well .
And the research shows that the best programs address six key areas : The first is the influence of family , friends and relationships .
The second is media and celebr@@ ity culture , then how to hand@@ le te@@ as@@ ing and bul@@ lying , the way we com@@ pe@@ te and compare with one another based on looks , talking about appear@@ ance — some people call this &quot; body talk &quot; or &quot; f@@ at talk &quot; — and finally , the f@@ ound@@ ations of resp@@ ecting and looking after yourself .
These six things are crucial starting points for anyone serious about deli@@ vering bo@@ dy@@ -@@ confidence education that works .
An education is critical , but t@@ ack@@ ling this problem is going to require each and everyone of us to step up and be better role models for the women and girls in our own lives .
Ch@@ all@@ eng@@ ing the status qu@@ o of how women are seen and talked about in our own cir@@ cles .
It is not okay that we ju@@ dge the contribu@@ tion of our politicians by their h@@ air@@ cu@@ ts or the size of their bre@@ as@@ ts , or to inf@@ er that the determin@@ ation or the success of an O@@ lym@@ pi@@ an is down to her not being a loo@@ ker .
We need to start jud@@ ging people by what they do , not what they look like .
We can all start by taking responsibility for the types of pictures and comm@@ ents that we pos@@ t on our own social networks .
We can compli@@ ment people based on their effort and their actions and not on their appear@@ ance .
And let me ask you , when was the last time that you k@@ iss@@ ed a mir@@ ror ?
U@@ l@@ timately , we need to work together as communities , as governments and as businesses to really change this culture of ours so that our kids grow up valu@@ ing their whole selves , valu@@ ing individu@@ ality , diversity , inclu@@ sion .
We need to put the people that are making a real difference on our pe@@ des@@ t@@ als , making a difference in the real world .
G@@ iv@@ ing them the air@@ time , because only then will we create a different world .
A world where our kids are free to become the best versions of themselves , where the way they think they look never hol@@ ds them back from being who they are or achiev@@ ing what they want in life .
Think about what this might mean for someone in your life .
Who have you got in mind ?
Is it your wife ?
Your sister ?
Your daughter ?
Your ni@@ e@@ ce ?
Your friend ? It could just be the woman a couple of se@@ ats away from you today .
What would it mean for her if she were fre@@ ed from that voice of her inner cri@@ tic , n@@ ag@@ ging her to have longer legs , thin@@ ner th@@ igh@@ s , smaller stom@@ ach , shor@@ ter feet ?
What could it mean for her if we over@@ came this and un@@ loc@@ ked her potential in that way ?
Right now , our culture &apos;s obs@@ ession with image is holding us all back .
But let &apos;s show our kids the truth .
Let &apos;s show them that the way you look is just one part of your identity and that the truth is we love them for who they are and what they do and how they make us feel .
Let &apos;s build self-@@ es@@ te@@ em into our school cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ u@@ ms .
Let &apos;s each and every one of us change the way we talk and compare ourselves to other people .
And let &apos;s work together as communities , from gr@@ ass@@ ro@@ ots to governments , so that the happy little one-@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds of today become the confi@@ dent chang@@ em@@ ak@@ ers of tomorrow .
Let &apos;s do this .
On No@@ v@@ ember 5@@ th , 1990 , a man named El@@ -@@ S@@ ay@@ y@@ id N@@ os@@ air walked into a hot@@ el in Manhattan and ass@@ ass@@ in@@ ated R@@ ab@@ b@@ i Me@@ ir K@@ a@@ han@@ e , the leader of the Je@@ wish De@@ fense Le@@ ague .
N@@ os@@ air was initi@@ ally found not gu@@ il@@ ty of the mur@@ der , but while ser@@ ving time on less@@ er charg@@ es , he and other men began planning attacks on a do@@ zen New York City land@@ mar@@ ks , including tun@@ n@@ els , syn@@ ag@@ o@@ gues and the United Nations head@@ quar@@ ters .
Th@@ ank@@ fully , those plans were fo@@ il@@ ed by an FBI inform@@ ant .
S@@ ad@@ ly , the 199@@ 3 bomb@@ ing of the World T@@ ra@@ de Center was not .
N@@ os@@ air would eventually be convic@@ ted for his invol@@ vement in the pl@@ ot .
El@@ -@@ S@@ ay@@ y@@ id N@@ os@@ air is my father .
I was born in P@@ it@@ t@@ s@@ bur@@ gh , P@@ enn@@ sy@@ l@@ van@@ ia in 198@@ 3 to him , an Egyp@@ tian engineer , and a lo@@ ving American mother and grade school teacher , who together tried their best to create a happy childhood for me .
It wasn &apos;t until I was seven years old that our family dynamic started to change .
My father ex@@ posed me to a side of Islam that few people , including the majority of Mus@@ lim@@ s , get to see .
It &apos;s been my experience that when people take the time to interact with one another , it doesn &apos;t take long to realize that for the most part , we all want the same things out of life .
However , in every religion , in every population , you &apos;ll find a small per@@ centage of people who hold so fer@@ v@@ ently to their beli@@ efs that they feel they must use any means necessary to make others live as they do .
A few months pri@@ or to his arr@@ est , he sat me down and expl@@ ained that for the past few wee@@ k@@ ends , he and some friends had been going to a sho@@ oting range on L@@ ong Island for target practice .
He told me I &apos;d be going with him the next morning .
We arrived at Cal@@ ver@@ ton S@@ ho@@ oting R@@ ange , which un@@ be@@ know@@ n@@ st to our group was being watched by the FBI .
When it was my turn to sho@@ ot , my father helped me hold the ri@@ f@@ le to my shoul@@ der and expl@@ ained how to ai@@ m at the target about 30 y@@ ards off .
That day , the last bul@@ let I shot hit the small orange light that sat on top of the target and to everyone &apos;s surprise , especially mine , the entire target bur@@ st into fl@@ ames .
My un@@ cle turned to the other men , and in Arab@@ ic said , &quot; I@@ b@@ n ab@@ u@@ h . &quot;
Like father , like son .
They all seemed to get a really big l@@ augh out of that comment , but it wasn &apos;t until a few years later that I fully understood what they thought was so funny .
They thought they saw in me the same destruction my father was capable of .
Those men would eventually be convic@@ ted of plac@@ ing a van filled with 1,@@ 500 pounds of explo@@ si@@ ves into the sub-@@ level parking lot of the World T@@ ra@@ de Center &apos;s North To@@ wer , caus@@ ing an explosion that killed six people and in@@ ju@@ red over 1,000 others .
These were the men I looked up to .
These were the men I called am@@ m@@ u , which means un@@ cle .
By the time I turned 19 , I had already moved 20 times in my life , and that inst@@ ability during my childhood didn &apos;t really provide an opportunity to make many friends .
Each time I would begin to feel comfortable around someone , it was time to p@@ ack up and move to the next town .
Be@@ ing the per@@ p@@ et@@ u@@ al new face in class , I was frequ@@ ently the target of bul@@ lies .
I kept my identity a secret from my class@@ mates to avoid being t@@ arg@@ eted , but as it turns out , being the qui@@ et , chu@@ b@@ by new kid in class was more than enough am@@ m@@ uni@@ tion .
So for the most part , I spent my time at home reading books and watching TV or playing video games .
For those reasons , my social skills were l@@ acking , to say the least , and growing up in a bi@@ got@@ ed hou@@ se@@ hold , I wasn &apos;t prepar@@ ed for the real world .
I &apos;d been raised to ju@@ dge people based on ar@@ bi@@ tr@@ ary measu@@ rem@@ ents , like a person &apos;s race or religion .
So what opened my eyes ?
One of my first experiences that challeng@@ ed this way of thinking was during the 2000 pres@@ identi@@ al elec@@ tions .
Th@@ r@@ ough a college pre@@ p program , I was able to take part in the National You@@ th Con@@ vention in Phil@@ ad@@ el@@ ph@@ ia .
My particular group &apos;s focus was on y@@ ou@@ th violence , and having been the victi@@ m of bul@@ lying for most of my life , this was a subject in which I felt particularly passionate .
The members of our group came from many different wal@@ ks of life .
One day toward the end of the con@@ vention , I found out that one of the kids I had be@@ fri@@ ended was Je@@ wish .
Now , it had taken several days for this detail to come to light , and I realized that there was no natural ani@@ mo@@ sity between the two of us .
I had never had a Je@@ wish friend before , and fran@@ kly I felt a sense of pri@@ de in having been able to over@@ come a barri@@ er that for most of my life I had been led to believe was insur@@ m@@ oun@@ table .
Another major turning point came when I found a summer job at B@@ us@@ ch G@@ ard@@ ens , an am@@ usement park .
There , I was ex@@ posed to people from all sorts of fai@@ ths and cultures , and that experience pro@@ ved to be fundamental to the development of my character .
Most of my life , I &apos;d been taught that hom@@ os@@ exu@@ ality was a s@@ in , and by ex@@ tension , that all gay people were a negative influence .
As chance would have it , I had the opportunity to work with some of the gay perform@@ ers and soon found that many were the k@@ ind@@ est , least jud@@ g@@ mental people I had ever met .
Be@@ ing bul@@ li@@ ed as a kid created a sense of empath@@ y in me toward the suffering of others , and it comes very un@@ natur@@ ally to me to treat people who are kind in any other way than how I would want to be treated .
Because of that feeling , I was able to contr@@ ast the st@@ ere@@ oty@@ pes I &apos;d been taught as a child with real life experience and interaction .
I don &apos;t know what it &apos;s like to be gay , but I &apos;m well acqu@@ ain@@ ted with being jud@@ ged for something that &apos;s beyond my control .
Then there was &quot; The D@@ ai@@ ly S@@ how . &quot;
On a ni@@ ghtly basis , J@@ on Ste@@ w@@ art forced me to be intell@@ ec@@ tually honest with myself about my own bi@@ go@@ try and helped me to realize that a person &apos;s race , religion or sexual ori@@ entation had nothing to do with the quality of one &apos;s character .
He was in many ways a father figure to me when I was in des@@ per@@ ate need of one .
In@@ spir@@ ation can often come from an un@@ expected place , and the fact that a Je@@ wish com@@ e@@ di@@ an had done more to posi@@ tively influence my world@@ view than my own extrem@@ ist father is not lost on me .
One day , I had a conversation with my mother about how my world@@ view was starting to change , and she said something to me that I will hold d@@ ear to my heart for as long as I live .
She looked at me with the w@@ ear@@ y eyes of someone who had experienced enough do@@ g@@ mati@@ s@@ m to last a lifetime , and said , &quot; I &apos;m ti@@ red of h@@ ating people . &quot;
In that instant , I realized how much negative energy it takes to hold that h@@ at@@ red inside of you .
Z@@ ak E@@ br@@ a@@ him is not my real name .
I changed it when my family decided to end our connection with my father and start a new life .
So why would I out myself and potenti@@ ally put myself in danger ?
Well , that &apos;s simple .
I do it in the hop@@ es that perhaps someone some@@ day who is comp@@ ell@@ ed to use violence may hear my story and realize that there is a better way , that although I had been subj@@ ected to this violent , int@@ ol@@ er@@ ant ide@@ ology , that I did not become f@@ an@@ ati@@ ci@@ zed .
Instead , I choose to use my experience to fight back against terrorism , against the bi@@ go@@ try .
I do it for the victims of terrorism and their loved ones , for the terrible pain and loss that terrorism has forced upon their lives .
For the victims of terrorism , I will speak out against these sen@@ sel@@ ess acts and con@@ dem@@ n my father &apos;s actions .
And with that simple fact , I stand here as pro@@ of that violence isn &apos;t inher@@ ent in one &apos;s religion or race , and the son does not have to follow the ways of his father .
I am not my father .
Thank you . Thank you , everybody . Thank you all . Thanks a lot .
Right now you have a movie playing inside your head .
It &apos;s an amazing multi-@@ track movie .
for what you &apos;re seeing and hearing right now , but that &apos;s just the start of it .
Your movie has smell and tas@@ te and touch .
It has a sense of your body , pain , hun@@ ger , org@@ as@@ ms .
It has emotions , anger and happiness .
It has mem@@ ories , like scen@@ es from your childhood playing before you .
And it has this constant vo@@ ic@@ e@@ over narrative in your stream of conscious thinking .
At the heart of this movie is you experi@@ encing all this directly .
This movie is your stream of consciousness , the subject of experience of the mind and the world .
Con@@ sci@@ ousness is one of the fundamental facts of human existence .
Each of us is conscious .
We all have our own inner movie , you and you and you .
There &apos;s nothing we know about more directly .
At least , I know about my consciousness directly .
I can &apos;t be certain that you guys are conscious .
Con@@ sci@@ ousness also is what makes life worth living .
If we weren &apos;t conscious , nothing in our lives would have meaning or value .
But at the same time , it &apos;s the most myst@@ er@@ ious phenomenon in the universe .
Why are we conscious ?
Why do we have these inner movies ?
Why aren &apos;t we just robots who process all this in@@ put , produce all that out@@ put , without experi@@ encing the inner movie at all ?
Right now , nobody knows the answers to those questions .
I &apos;m going to suggest that to integr@@ ate consciousness into science , some radical ideas may be needed .
Some people say a science of consciousness is impossible .
Science , by its nature , is objec@@ tive .
Con@@ sci@@ ousness , by its nature , is subj@@ ective .
So there can never be a science of consciousness .
For much of the 20th century , that view held s@@ way .
P@@ sy@@ cho@@ logists studied behavior objec@@ tively , neuro@@ scientists studied the brain objec@@ tively , and nobody even mentioned consciousness .
Even 30 years ago , when TED got started , there was very little scientific work on consciousness .
Now , about 20 years ago , all that began to change .
N@@ euro@@ scientists like Franc@@ is C@@ ri@@ ck and physi@@ cis@@ ts like Ro@@ ger Pen@@ rose said now is the time for science to attack consciousness .
And since then , there &apos;s been a real explosion , a flo@@ wer@@ ing of scientific work on consciousness .
And this work has been wonderful . It &apos;s been great .
But it also has some fundamental limit@@ ations so far .
of the science of consciousness in recent years has been the search for cor@@ relations , cor@@ relations between certain areas of the brain and certain states of consciousness .
We saw some of this kind of work from N@@ ancy K@@ an@@ wis@@ her and the wonderful work she pres@@ ented just a few minutes ago .
Now we understand much better , for example , the kinds of brain areas that go along with the conscious experience of seeing faces or of feeling pain or of feeling happy .
But this is still a science of cor@@ relations .
It &apos;s not a science of explan@@ ations .
We know that these brain areas go along with certain kinds of conscious experience , but we don &apos;t know why they do .
I like to put this by saying that this kind of work from neuro@@ science is ans@@ wer@@ ing some of the questions we want ans@@ wer@@ ed about consciousness , the questions about what certain brain areas do and what they cor@@ rel@@ ate with .
But in a certain sense , those are the easy problems .
No kno@@ ck on the neuro@@ scientists .
There are no truly easy problems with consciousness .
But it doesn &apos;t address the real myst@@ ery at the core of this subject : why is it that all that physical proc@@ essing in a brain should be ac@@ compan@@ i@@ ed by consciousness at all ?
Why is there this inner subj@@ ective movie ?
Right now , we don &apos;t really have a b@@ ead on that .
And you might say , let &apos;s just give neuro@@ science a few years .
It &apos;ll turn out to be another emerg@@ ent phenomenon like traffic jam@@ s , like hur@@ ri@@ can@@ es , like life , and we &apos;ll figure it out .
The classi@@ cal cases of emerg@@ ence are all cases of emerg@@ ent behavior , how a traffic j@@ am behav@@ es , how a hur@@ ri@@ can@@ e func@@ tions , how a living organis@@ m re@@ produ@@ ces and adap@@ ts and met@@ abo@@ liz@@ es , all questions about objec@@ tive func@@ tioning .
You could apply that to the human brain in expl@@ aining some of the behavi@@ ors and the func@@ tions of the human brain as emerg@@ ent phenomen@@ a : how we walk , how we talk , how we play ch@@ ess , all these questions about behavior .
But when it comes to consciousness , questions about behavior are among the easy problems .
When it comes to the hard problem , that &apos;s the question of why is it that all this behavior is ac@@ compan@@ i@@ ed by subj@@ ective experience ?
And here , the standard paradig@@ m of emerg@@ ence , even the standard paradig@@ ms of neuro@@ science , don &apos;t really , so far , have that much to say .
Now , I &apos;m a scientific materi@@ alis@@ t at heart .
I want a scientific theory of consciousness that works , and for a long time , I b@@ ang@@ ed my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pu@@ rely physical terms that would work .
But I eventually came to the conclusion that that just didn &apos;t work for syst@@ em@@ atic reasons .
It &apos;s a long story , but the core idea is just that what you get from pu@@ rely re@@ duc@@ tion@@ ist explan@@ ations in physical terms , in br@@ ain@@ -@@ based terms , is stories about the func@@ tioning of a system , its structure , its dynam@@ ics , the behavior it produ@@ ces , great for solving the easy problems — how we be@@ have , how we function — but when it comes to subj@@ ective experience — why does all this feel like something from the inside ? —
that &apos;s something fundament@@ ally new , and it &apos;s always a further question .
So I think we &apos;re at a kind of im@@ pas@@ se here .
We &apos;ve got this wonderful , great chain of explan@@ ation , we &apos;re used to it , where physics expl@@ ains chemistry , chemistry expl@@ ains biology , biology expl@@ ains parts of psycho@@ logy .
But consciousness doesn &apos;t seem to fit into this picture .
On the one hand , it &apos;s a d@@ atu@@ m that we &apos;re conscious .
On the other hand , we don &apos;t know how to ac@@ com@@ mod@@ ate it into our scientific view of the world .
So I think consciousness right now is a kind of an@@ om@@ al@@ y , one that we need to integr@@ ate into our view of the world , but we don &apos;t yet see how .
F@@ ac@@ ed with an an@@ om@@ al@@ y like this , radical ideas may be needed , and I think that we may need one or two ideas that initi@@ ally seem crazy before we can come to gri@@ ps with consciousness scienti@@ fically .
Now , there are a few candi@@ dat@@ es for what those crazy ideas might be .
My friend Dan Den@@ net@@ t , who &apos;s here today , has one .
His crazy idea is that there is no hard problem of consciousness .
The whole idea of the inner subj@@ ective movie invol@@ ves a kind of illusion or con@@ fusion .
Actually , all we &apos;ve got to do is explain the objec@@ tive func@@ tions , the behavi@@ ors of the brain , and then we &apos;ve expl@@ ained everything that needs to be expl@@ ained .
Well I say , more power to him .
That &apos;s the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if you want to have a pu@@ rely re@@ duc@@ tion@@ ist br@@ ain@@ -@@ based theory of consciousness .
At the same time , for me and for many other people , that view is a bit too close to simply den@@ ying the d@@ atu@@ m of consciousness to be satis@@ factory .
So I go in a different direction .
In the time re@@ main@@ ing , I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think may have some promise .
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is fundamental .
Ph@@ ysi@@ cis@@ ts sometimes take some aspects of the universe as fundamental building blocks : space and time and mass .
They pos@@ tu@@ late fundamental laws go@@ ver@@ ning them , like the laws of grav@@ ity or of quantum mechan@@ ics .
These fundamental properties and laws aren &apos;t expl@@ ained in terms of anything more basic .
R@@ a@@ ther , they &apos;re taken as prim@@ itive , and you build up the world from there .
Now sometimes , the list of fundament@@ als exp@@ ands .
In the 19@@ th century , M@@ ax@@ well figured out that you can &apos;t explain elec@@ trom@@ ag@@ ne@@ tic phenomen@@ a in terms of the existing fundament@@ als — space , time , mass , New@@ ton &apos;s laws — so he pos@@ tu@@ l@@ ated fundamental laws of elec@@ trom@@ ag@@ ne@@ tis@@ m and pos@@ tu@@ l@@ ated electric charge as a fundamental el@@ ement that those laws go@@ ver@@ n .
I think that &apos;s the situation we &apos;re in with consciousness .
If you can &apos;t explain consciousness in terms of the existing fundament@@ als — space , time , mass , charge — then as a matter of logic , you need to exp@@ and the list .
The natural thing to do is to pos@@ tu@@ late consciousness itself as something fundamental , a fundamental building block of nature .
This doesn &apos;t mean you suddenly can &apos;t do science with it .
This op@@ ens up the way for you to do science with it .
What we then need is to study the fundamental laws go@@ ver@@ ning consciousness , the laws that connect consciousness to other fundament@@ als : space , time , mass , physical processes .
Ph@@ ysi@@ cis@@ ts sometimes say that we want fundamental laws so simple that we could write them on the front of a t-@@ shir@@ t .
Well I think something like that is the situation we &apos;re in with consciousness .
We want to find fundamental laws so simple we could write them on the front of a t-@@ shir@@ t .
We don &apos;t know what those laws are yet , but that &apos;s what we &apos;re after .
The second crazy idea is that consciousness might be universal .
Every system might have some degree of consciousness .
This view is sometimes called pan@@ psych@@ ism : p@@ an for all , psy@@ ch for mind , every system is conscious , not just humans , dogs , mi@@ ce , flies , but even Ro@@ b K@@ night &apos;s microbes , el@@ ement@@ ary particles .
Even a phot@@ on has some degree of consciousness .
The idea is not that phot@@ ons are intelligent or thinking .
It &apos;s not that a phot@@ on is wr@@ acked with ang@@ st because it &apos;s thinking , &quot; A@@ w@@ w , I &apos;m always bu@@ zz@@ ing around near the speed of light .
I never get to slow down and smell the ro@@ ses . &quot;
No , not like that .
But the thought is maybe phot@@ ons might have some el@@ ement of ra@@ w , subj@@ ective feeling , some prim@@ itive pre@@ cur@@ s@@ or to consciousness .
This may sound a bit k@@ oo@@ ky to you .
I mean , why would anyone think such a crazy thing ?
Some motivation comes from the first crazy idea , that consciousness is fundamental .
If it &apos;s fundamental , like space and time and mass , it &apos;s natural to suppose that it might be universal too , the way they are .
It &apos;s also worth not@@ ing that although the idea seems counter@@ intu@@ itive to us , it &apos;s much less counter@@ intu@@ itive to people from different cultures , where the human mind is seen as much more continu@@ ous with nature .
A deeper motivation comes from the idea that perhaps the most simple and powerful way to find fundamental laws connec@@ ting consciousness to physical proc@@ essing is to link consciousness to information .
Wh@@ er@@ ever there &apos;s information proc@@ essing , there &apos;s consciousness .
Com@@ ple@@ x information proc@@ essing , like in a human , complex consciousness .
Sim@@ ple information proc@@ essing , simple consciousness .
A really exciting thing is in recent years a neuro@@ scientist , Gi@@ u@@ li@@ o T@@ on@@ on@@ i , has taken this kind of theory and developed it ri@@ gor@@ ously with a mathematical theory .
He has a mathematical measure of information integr@@ ation which he calls ph@@ i , mea@@ suring the amount of information integr@@ ated in a system .
And he suppos@@ es that ph@@ i goes along with consciousness .
So in a human brain , incredibly large amount of information integr@@ ation , high degree of ph@@ i , a whole lot of consciousness .
In a mouse , medi@@ um degree of information integr@@ ation , still pretty significant , pretty serious amount of consciousness .
But as you go down to wor@@ ms , microbes , particles , the amount of ph@@ i fall@@ s off .
The amount of information integr@@ ation fall@@ s off , but it &apos;s still non-@@ zero .
On T@@ on@@ on@@ i &apos;s theory , there &apos;s still going to be a non-@@ zero degree of consciousness .
In effect , he &apos;s propos@@ ing a fundamental law of consciousness : high ph@@ i , high consciousness .
Now , I don &apos;t know if this theory is right , but it &apos;s actually perhaps the leading theory right now in the science of consciousness , and it &apos;s been used to integr@@ ate a whole range of scientific data , and it does have a nice property that it is in fact simple enough you can write it on the front of a t-@@ shir@@ t .
Another final motivation is that pan@@ psych@@ ism might help us to integr@@ ate consciousness into the physical world .
Ph@@ ysi@@ cis@@ ts and philosoph@@ ers have often obser@@ ved that physics is curi@@ ously abstr@@ act .
It descri@@ bes the structure of reality using a bunch of equ@@ ations , but it doesn &apos;t tell us about the reality that under@@ lies it .
As Steph@@ en Haw@@ king puts it , what puts the fire into the equ@@ ations ?
Well , on the pan@@ psych@@ ist view , you can leave the equ@@ ations of physics as they are , but you can take them to be descri@@ bing the flu@@ x of consciousness .
That &apos;s what physics really is ultimately doing , descri@@ bing the flu@@ x of consciousness .
On this view , it &apos;s consciousness that puts the fire into the equ@@ ations .
On that view , consciousness doesn &apos;t d@@ angle outside the physical world as some kind of extra .
It &apos;s there right at its heart .
This view , I think , the pan@@ psych@@ ist view , has the potential to trans@@ figure our relationship to nature , and it may have some pretty serious social and eth@@ ical consequences .
Some of these may be counter@@ intu@@ itive .
I used to think I shouldn &apos;t eat anything which is conscious , so therefore I should be veget@@ arian .
Now , if you &apos;re a pan@@ psych@@ ist and you take that view , you &apos;re going to go very hun@@ gry .
So I think when you think about it , this t@@ ends to trans@@ figure your vie@@ ws , wh@@ ereas what matters for eth@@ ical pur@@ pos@@ es and moral consider@@ ations , not so much the fact of consciousness , but the degree and the complexity of consciousness .
It &apos;s also natural to ask about consciousness in other systems , like computers .
What about the artifici@@ ally intelligent system in the movie &quot; Her , &quot; Sam@@ an@@ th@@ a ?
Is she conscious ?
Well , if you take the inform@@ ational , pan@@ psych@@ ist view , she certainly has complicated information proc@@ essing and integr@@ ation , so the answer is very likely yes , she is conscious .
If that &apos;s right , it rai@@ ses pretty serious eth@@ ical issues about both the eth@@ ics of developing intelligent computer systems and the eth@@ ics of turning them off .
Fin@@ ally , you might ask about the consciousness of whole groups , the planet .
Does Canada have its own consciousness ?
Or at a more local level , does an integr@@ ated group like the audience at a TED conference , are we right now having a collective TED consciousness , an inner movie for this collective TED group which is distinc@@ t from the inner movies of each of our parts ?
I don &apos;t know the answer to that question , but I think it &apos;s at least one worth taking seriously .
Okay , so this pan@@ psych@@ ist vision , it is a radical one , and I don &apos;t know that it &apos;s correct .
I &apos;m actually more confi@@ dent about the first crazy idea , that consciousness is fundamental , than about the second one , that it &apos;s universal .
I mean , the view rai@@ ses any number of questions , has any number of challenges , like how do those little bits of consciousness add up to the kind of complex consciousness we know and love .
If we can answer those questions , then I think we &apos;re going to be well on our way to a serious theory of consciousness .
If not , well , this is the hard@@ est problem perhaps in science and philosoph@@ y .
We can &apos;t expect to solve it over@@ night .
But I do think we &apos;re going to figure it out eventually .
Un@@ der@@ standing consciousness is a real key , I think , both to understanding the universe and to understanding ourselves .
It may just take the right crazy idea .
Thank you .
I grew up in a very small country town in V@@ ic@@ t@@ ori@@ a .
I had a very normal , low-@@ key kind of up@@ bringing .
I went to school , I hun@@ g out with my friends , I f@@ ought with my youn@@ ger s@@ is@@ ters .
It was all very normal .
And when I was 15 , a member of my local community appro@@ ach@@ ed my parents and wanted to nom@@ in@@ ate me for a community achiev@@ ement aw@@ ard .
And my parents said , &quot; H@@ m , that &apos;s really nice , but there &apos;s kind of one gl@@ ar@@ ing problem with that .
She hasn &apos;t actually achiev@@ ed anything . &quot; And they were right , you know .
I went to school , I got good mar@@ ks , I had a very low-@@ key after school job in my mu@@ m &apos;s h@@ air@@ dr@@ essing sal@@ on , and I spent a lot of time watching &quot; Bu@@ ff@@ y the V@@ am@@ p@@ ire S@@ layer &quot; and &quot; D@@ aw@@ son &apos;s C@@ re@@ ek . &quot;
Yeah , I know . What a contra@@ diction .
But they were right , you know .
I wasn &apos;t doing anything that was out of the ordinary at all .
I wasn &apos;t doing anything that could be considered an achiev@@ ement if you took dis@@ ability out of the equ@@ ation .
Y@@ ears later , I was on my second teaching round in a M@@ el@@ bour@@ ne high school , and I was about 20 minutes into a year 11 legal studies class when this boy put up his hand and said , &quot; Hey mis@@ s , when are you going to start doing your speech ? &quot;
And I said , &quot; What speech ? &quot;
You know , I &apos;d been talking them about de@@ fam@@ ation law for a good 20 minutes .
And he said , &quot; You know , like , your motiv@@ ational speaking .
You know , when people in whe@@ el@@ ch@@ airs come to school , they usually say , like , inspir@@ ational stuff ? &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s usually in the big h@@ all . &quot;
And that &apos;s when it d@@ aw@@ ned on me : This kid had only ever experienced dis@@ ab@@ led people as objects of inspiration .
We are not , to this kid -- and it &apos;s not his fau@@ lt , I mean , that &apos;s true for many of us .
For lots of us , dis@@ ab@@ led people are not our teachers or our doctors or our man@@ ic@@ ur@@ ists .
We &apos;re not real people . We are there to inspire .
And in fact , I am sitting on this stage looking like I do in this whe@@ el@@ chair , and you are probably kind of exp@@ ecting me to inspire you . Right ? Yeah .
Well , la@@ dies and gentlemen , I &apos;m afraid I &apos;m going to dis@@ ap@@ point you dram@@ atically .
I am not here to inspire you .
I am here to tell you that we have been li@@ ed to about dis@@ ability .
Yeah , we &apos;ve been sold the lie that dis@@ ability is a B@@ ad Th@@ ing , capital B , capital T .
It &apos;s a bad thing , and to live with a dis@@ ability makes you excep@@ tional .
It &apos;s not a bad thing , and it doesn &apos;t make you excep@@ tional .
And in the past few years , we &apos;ve been able to propag@@ ate this lie even further via social media .
You may have seen images like this one : &quot; The only dis@@ ability in life is a bad attitude . &quot;
Or this one : &quot; Your ex@@ cu@@ se is inv@@ ali@@ d . &quot; In@@ deed .
Or this one : &quot; Be@@ fore you qu@@ it , try ! &quot;
These are just a couple of examples , but there are a lot of these images out there .
You know , you might have seen the one , the little girl with no hands drawing a picture with a pen@@ c@@ il held in her mouth .
You might have seen a child running on carbon fi@@ ber pro@@ s@@ thetic legs .
And these images , there are lots of them out there , they are what we call inspiration por@@ n .
And I use the term por@@ n deli@@ ber@@ ately , because they objec@@ ti@@ fy one group of people for the benefit of another group of people .
So in this case , we &apos;re objec@@ ti@@ fying dis@@ ab@@ led people for the benefit of non@@ dis@@ ab@@ led people .
The purpose of these images is to inspire you , to motiv@@ ate you , so that we can look at them and think , &quot; Well , how@@ ever bad my life is , it could be worse .
I could be that person . &quot;
But what if you are that person ?
I &apos;ve lost count of the number of times that I &apos;ve been appro@@ ach@@ ed by str@@ angers wan@@ ting to tell me that they think I &apos;m br@@ ave or inspir@@ ational , and this was long before my work had any kind of public pro@@ file .
They were just kind of con@@ grat@@ ul@@ ating me for manag@@ ing to get up in the morning and remember my own name . And it is objec@@ ti@@ fying .
These images , those images objec@@ ti@@ fy dis@@ ab@@ led people for the benefit of non@@ dis@@ ab@@ led people .
They are there so that you can look at them and think that things aren &apos;t so bad for you , to put your wor@@ ries into perspective .
And life as a dis@@ ab@@ led person is actually some@@ what difficult .
We do over@@ come some things .
But the things that we &apos;re over@@ coming are not the things that you think they are .
They are not things to do with our bodies .
I use the term &quot; dis@@ ab@@ led people &quot; quite deli@@ ber@@ ately , because I sub@@ s@@ cri@@ be to what &apos;s called the social model of dis@@ ability , which tells us that we are more dis@@ ab@@ led by the society that we live in than by our bodies and our diagno@@ ses .
So I have lived in this body a long time .
I &apos;m quite fond of it .
It does the things that I need it to do , and I &apos;ve learned to use it to the best of its capacity just as you have , and that &apos;s the thing about those kids in those pictures as well .
They &apos;re not doing anything out of the ordinary .
They are just using their bodies to the best of their capacity .
So is it really fair to objec@@ ti@@ fy them in the way that we do , to share those images ?
People , when they say , &quot; You &apos;re an inspiration , &quot; they mean it as a compli@@ ment .
And I know why it happens .
It &apos;s because of the lie , it &apos;s because we &apos;ve been sold this lie that dis@@ ability makes you excep@@ tional .
And it hon@@ est@@ ly doesn &apos;t . And I know what you &apos;re thinking .
You know , I &apos;m up here b@@ ag@@ ging out inspiration , and you &apos;re thinking , &quot; Je@@ ez , St@@ el@@ la , aren &apos;t you inspired sometimes by some things ? &quot;
And the thing is , I am .
I learn from other dis@@ ab@@ led people all the time .
I &apos;m learning not that I am lu@@ c@@ ki@@ er than them , though .
I am learning that it &apos;s a gen@@ i@@ us idea to use a pair of bar@@ bec@@ ue ton@@ gs to pick up things that you dro@@ pped . I &apos;m learning that ni@@ f@@ ty trick where you can charge your mobile phone battery from your chair battery .
Gen@@ i@@ us .
We are learning from each others &apos; strength and end@@ ur@@ ance , not against our bodies and our diagno@@ ses , but against a world that excep@@ tion@@ aliz@@ es and objec@@ ti@@ fi@@ es us .
I really think that this lie that we &apos;ve been sold about dis@@ ability is the greatest in@@ justice .
It makes life hard for us .
And that quote , &quot; The only dis@@ ability in life is a bad attitude , &quot; the reason that that &apos;s bul@@ l@@ sh@@ it is because it &apos;s just not true , because of the social model of dis@@ ability .
No amount of sm@@ iling at a flight of st@@ airs has ever made it turn into a ram@@ p .
N@@ ever . S@@ mil@@ ing at a television screen isn &apos;t going to make closed cap@@ tions appear for people who are dea@@ f .
No amount of standing in the middle of a boo@@ k@@ shop and radi@@ ating a positive attitude is going to turn all those books into b@@ rai@@ lle .
It &apos;s just not going to happen .
I really want to live in a world where dis@@ ability is not the exception , but the nor@@ m .
I want to live in a world where a 15@@ -year-old girl sitting in her be@@ dro@@ om watching &quot; Bu@@ ff@@ y the V@@ am@@ p@@ ire S@@ layer &quot; isn &apos;t refer@@ red to as achiev@@ ing anything because she &apos;s doing it sitting down .
I want to live in a world where we don &apos;t have such low expect@@ ations of dis@@ ab@@ led people that we are con@@ grat@@ ul@@ ated for getting out of bed and rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ing our own names in the morning .
I want to live in a world where we value gen@@ u@@ ine achiev@@ ement for dis@@ ab@@ led people , and I want to live in a world where a kid in year 11 in a M@@ el@@ bour@@ ne high school is not one bit surprised that his new teacher is a whe@@ el@@ chair user .
Dis@@ ability doesn &apos;t make you excep@@ tional , but ques@@ tioning what you think you know about it does .
Thank you .
What do augment@@ ed reality and professional football have to do with empath@@ y ?
And what is the air speed vel@@ oc@@ ity of an un@@ lad@@ en s@@ wal@@ low ?
Now unfortunately , I &apos;m only going to answer one of those questions today , so please , try and cont@@ ain your dis@@ ap@@ po@@ int@@ ment .
When most people think about augment@@ ed reality , they think about &quot; Min@@ ority Re@@ port &quot; and Tom C@@ ru@@ ise w@@ aving his hands in the air , but augment@@ ed reality is not science fiction .
Au@@ g@@ ment@@ ed reality is something that will happen in our lifetime , and it will happen because we have the tools to make it happen , and people need to be aware of that , because augment@@ ed reality will change our lives just as much as the Internet and the cell phone .
Now how do we get to augment@@ ed reality ?
Ste@@ p one is the step I &apos;m wearing right now , Google Gl@@ ass .
I &apos;m sure many of you are familiar with Google Gl@@ ass .
What you may not be familiar with is that Google Gl@@ ass is a device that will allow you to see what I see .
It will allow you to experience what it is like to be a professional ath@@ le@@ te on the field .
Right now , the only way you can be on the field is for me to try and describe it to you .
I have to use words .
I have to create a fr@@ am@@ ework that you then fill in with your imagination .
With Google Gl@@ ass , we can put that underneath a hel@@ met , and we can get a sense of what it &apos;s like to be running down the field at 100 miles an hour , your blood pou@@ n@@ ding in your ears .
You can get a sense of what it &apos;s like to have a 25@@ 0-@@ pou@@ nd man s@@ printing at you trying to dec@@ ap@@ it@@ ate you with every oun@@ ce of his being .
And I &apos;ve been on the rece@@ iv@@ ing end of that , and it doesn &apos;t feel very good .
Now , I have some foot@@ age to show you of what it &apos;s like to wear Google Gl@@ ass underneath the hel@@ met to give you a tas@@ te of that .
Un@@ fortunately , it &apos;s not N@@ F@@ L practice foot@@ age because the N@@ F@@ L thinks emerg@@ ent technology is what happens when a sub@@ marine surfaces , but — — we do what we can .
So let &apos;s pull up some video .
Chris K@@ lu@@ we : Go .
U@@ gh , getting t@@ ack@@ led suc@@ ks .
H@@ old on , let &apos;s get a little closer .
All right , ready ?
Go !
Chris K@@ lu@@ we : So as you can see , small tas@@ te of what it &apos;s like to get t@@ ack@@ led on the football field from the perspective of the t@@ ack@@ le@@ e .
Now , you may have noticed there are some people missing there : the rest of the team .
We have some video of that cour@@ tes@@ y of the University of Washington .
Qu@@ ar@@ ter@@ back : Hey , M@@ ice 5@@ 4 ! M@@ ice 5@@ 4 !
B@@ lue 8 ! B@@ lue 8 ! Go !
Oh !
C@@ K : So again , this takes you a little bit closer to what it &apos;s like to be on that field , but this is no@@ where what it &apos;s like to be on the N@@ F@@ L .
F@@ ans want that experience .
F@@ ans want to be on that field .
They want to be their favorite players , and they &apos;ve already talked to me on YouTube , they &apos;ve talked to me on Twitter , saying , &quot; Hey , can you get this on a quar@@ ter@@ back ?
Can you get this on a running back ?
We want that experience . &quot;
Well , once we have that experience with Go@@ Pr@@ o and Google Gl@@ ass , how do we make it more immer@@ sive ?
How do we take that next step ?
Well , we take that step by going to something called the O@@ cul@@ us Ri@@ ft , which I &apos;m sure many of you are also familiar with .
The O@@ cul@@ us Ri@@ ft has been described as one of the most re@@ alis@@ tic virtual reality devices ever created , and that is not empty hy@@ pe .
I &apos;m going to show you why that is not empty hy@@ pe with this video .
Man : Oh ! Oh !
No ! No ! No ! I don &apos;t want to play anymore ! No !
Oh my God ! A@@ a@@ a@@ ah !
C@@ K : So that is the experience of a man on a rol@@ ler co@@ aster in fear of his life .
What do you think that fan &apos;s experience is going to be when we take the video foot@@ age of an A@@ dri@@ an P@@ eter@@ son bur@@ sting through the line , before s@@ printing in for a tou@@ ch@@ down ?
What do you think that fan &apos;s experience is going to be when he &apos;s M@@ es@@ si s@@ printing down the pit@@ ch putting the ball in the back of the net , or Fe@@ der@@ er ser@@ ving in W@@ im@@ ble@@ don ?
What do you think his experience is going to be when he is going down the side of a mountain at over 70 miles an hour as an O@@ lym@@ pic down@@ h@@ ill ski@@ er ?
I think adult di@@ aper s@@ ales may sur@@ ge .
But this is not yet augment@@ ed reality .
This is only virtual reality , V@@ .@@ R .
How do we get to augment@@ ed reality , A@@ .@@ R@@ . ?
We get to augment@@ ed reality when co@@ aches and manag@@ ers and ow@@ ners look at this information stre@@ aming in that people want to see , and they say , &quot; How do we use this to make our te@@ ams better ?
How do we use this to win games ? &quot;
Because te@@ ams always use technology to win games .
They like win@@ ning . It makes them money .
So a bri@@ ef history of technology in the N@@ F@@ L .
In 196@@ 5 , the Bal@@ ti@@ more Col@@ ts put a wr@@ ist@@ band on their quar@@ ter@@ back to allow him to call plays qu@@ ic@@ ker .
They ended up win@@ ning a Su@@ per Bo@@ w@@ l that year .
O@@ ther te@@ ams followed suit .
More people watched the game because it was more exciting .
It was faster .
In 199@@ 4 , the N@@ F@@ L put hel@@ met radi@@ os into the hel@@ me@@ ts of the quar@@ ter@@ b@@ acks , and later the de@@ fense .
More people watched games because it was faster .
It was more entert@@ aining .
In 20@@ 23 , imagine you &apos;re a player walking back to the hu@@ dd@@ le , and you have your next play dis@@ played right in front of your face on your clear plastic vis@@ or that you already wear right now .
No more having to worry about for@@ getting plays .
No more wor@@ rying about having to mem@@ or@@ ize your play@@ book .
You just go out and re@@ act .
And co@@ aches really want this , because miss@@ ed as@@ sign@@ ments lose you games , and co@@ aches hate losing games .
L@@ os@@ ing games gets you fi@@ red as a co@@ ach .
They don &apos;t want that .
But augment@@ ed reality is not just an en@@ h@@ anced play@@ book .
Au@@ g@@ ment@@ ed reality is also a way to take all that data and use it in real time to en@@ h@@ ance how you play the game .
What would that be like ?
Well , a very simple set@@ up would be a camera on each corner of the st@@ adi@@ um looking down , giving you a bird &apos;@@ s-@@ eye view of all the people down there .
You also have information from hel@@ met sens@@ ors and acceler@@ om@@ eters , technology that &apos;s being worked on right now .
You take all that information , and you stream it to your players .
The good te@@ ams stream it in a way that the players can use .
The bad ones have information over@@ load .
That determin@@ es good te@@ ams from bad .
And now , your I@@ .@@ T@@ . de@@ partment is just as important as your s@@ cou@@ ting de@@ partment , and dat@@ a-@@ min@@ ing is not for ner@@ ds anymore .
It &apos;s also for j@@ oc@@ ks . Who knew ?
What would that look like on the field ?
Well , imagine you &apos;re the quar@@ ter@@ back .
You take the sn@@ ap and you drop back .
You &apos;re scann@@ ing down@@ field for an open rece@@ i@@ ver .
All of a sudden , a bright fl@@ ash on the left side of your vis@@ or lets you know , blind side lin@@ e@@ back@@ er is bl@@ it@@ zing in .
Nor@@ m@@ ally , you wouldn &apos;t be able to see him , but the augment@@ ed reality system lets you know .
You step up into the po@@ cket .
Another fl@@ ash al@@ er@@ ts you to an open rece@@ i@@ ver .
You throw the ball , but you &apos;re hit right as you throw .
The ball comes off track .
You don &apos;t know where it &apos;s going to land .
However , on the rece@@ i@@ ver &apos;s vis@@ or , he sees a pat@@ ch of gr@@ ass light up , and he knows to read@@ just .
He goes , cat@@ ches the ball , s@@ prin@@ ts in , tou@@ ch@@ down .
Cro@@ w@@ d goes wild , and the f@@ ans are with him every step of the way , watching from every perspective .
Now this is something that will create massive excit@@ ement in the game .
It will make tons of people watch , because people want this experience .
F@@ ans want to be on the field .
They want to be their favorite player .
Au@@ g@@ ment@@ ed reality will be a part of sports , because it &apos;s too prof@@ itable not to .
But the question I ask you is , is that &apos;s all that we &apos;re content to use augment@@ ed reality for ?
Are we going to use it sol@@ ely for our pan@@ em , our cir@@ cen@@ ses , our entert@@ ain@@ ment as normal ?
Because I believe that we can use augment@@ ed reality for something more .
I believe we can use augment@@ ed reality as a way to fo@@ ster more empath@@ y within the human species itself , by literally showing someone what it looks like to walk a mile in another person &apos;s shoes .
We know what this technology is worth to sports le@@ agues .
It &apos;s worth reven@@ ue , to the tune of billions of dollars a year .
But what is this technology worth to a teacher in a classroom trying to show a bul@@ ly just how har@@ m@@ ful his actions are from the perspective of the victi@@ m ?
What is this technology worth to a gay U@@ g@@ and@@ an or Rus@@ sian trying to show the world what it &apos;s like living under pers@@ ec@@ ution ?
What is this technology worth to a Com@@ man@@ der H@@ ad@@ field or a N@@ eil de@@ Gr@@ as@@ se Ty@@ son trying to inspire a generation of children to think more about space and science instead of quar@@ ter@@ ly re@@ ports and K@@ ard@@ as@@ hi@@ ans ?
L@@ adi@@ es and gentlemen , augment@@ ed reality is coming .
The questions we ask , the choices we make , and the challenges we face are , as always , up to us .
Thank you .
I recently reti@@ red from the California H@@ igh@@ way P@@ a@@ tro@@ l after 23 years of service .
The majority of those 23 years was spent p@@ atr@@ oll@@ ing the sou@@ thern end of Mar@@ in C@@ oun@@ ty , which inclu@@ des the Gol@@ den G@@ ate Bri@@ dge .
The bridge is an i@@ con@@ ic structure , known worldwide for its beautiful vie@@ ws of San Francisco , the Paci@@ fic O@@ ce@@ an , and its inspir@@ ing architecture .
Un@@ fortunately , it is also a mag@@ net for suicide , being one of the most uti@@ li@@ zed sites in the world .
The Gol@@ den G@@ ate Bri@@ dge opened in 19@@ 3@@ 7 .
Jo@@ sep@@ h S@@ tr@@ aus@@ s , chi@@ ef engineer in charge of building the bridge , was quot@@ ed as saying , &quot; The bridge is prac@@ tically su@@ ici@@ de-@@ pro@@ of .
Su@@ ici@@ de from the bridge is ne@@ ither practical nor probable . &quot;
But since its opening , over 1,@@ 600 people have le@@ ap@@ t to their death from that bridge .
Some believe that trav@@ eling between the two to@@ wers will lead you to another dimension -- this bridge has been rom@@ anti@@ ci@@ zed as such — that the fall from that fre@@ es you from all your wor@@ ries and gri@@ ef , and the wat@@ ers below will clean@@ se your sou@@ l .
But let me tell you what actually occu@@ rs when the bridge is used as a means of suicide .
After a free fall of four to five seconds , the body stri@@ kes the water at about 75 miles an hour .
That impact sh@@ at@@ ters b@@ ones , some of which then pun@@ c@@ ture v@@ ital org@@ ans .
Most die on impact .
Those that don &apos;t gener@@ ally fl@@ ail in the water hel@@ pl@@ ess@@ ly , and then dro@@ wn .
I don &apos;t think that those who cont@@ empl@@ ate this method of suicide realize how gr@@ is@@ ly a death that they will face .
This is the cord .
Ex@@ cept for around the two to@@ wers , there is 32 in@@ ches of ste@@ el parall@@ eling the bridge .
This is where most folks stand before taking their lives .
I can tell you from experience that once the person is on that cord , and at their dark@@ est time , it is very difficult to bring them back .
I took this photo last year as this young woman spoke to an off@@ ic@@ er cont@@ empl@@ ating her life .
I want to tell you very happ@@ ily that we were successful that day in getting her back over the rai@@ l .
When I first began working on the bridge , we had no form@@ al training .
You stru@@ ggl@@ ed to fun@@ nel your way through these calls .
This was not only a dis@@ service to those cont@@ empl@@ ating suicide , but to the off@@ ic@@ ers as well .
We &apos;ve come a long , long way since then .
Now , v@@ eter@@ an off@@ ic@@ ers and psycho@@ logists train new off@@ ic@@ ers .
This is J@@ ason Gar@@ ber .
I met J@@ ason on Ju@@ ly 22 of last year when I get received a call of a possible su@@ ic@@ id@@ al subject sitting on the cord near mid@@ sp@@ an .
I respon@@ ded , and when I arrived , I obser@@ ved J@@ ason speaking to a Gol@@ den G@@ ate Bri@@ dge off@@ ic@@ er .
J@@ ason was just 32 years old and had flo@@ wn out here from New Jer@@ sey .
As a matter of fact , he had flo@@ wn out here on two other occas@@ ions from New Jer@@ sey to attemp@@ t suicide on this bridge .
After about an hour of speaking with J@@ ason , he asked us if we knew the story of P@@ and@@ or@@ a &apos;s box .
R@@ ec@@ all@@ ing your Gre@@ ek my@@ tho@@ logy , Z@@ eus created P@@ and@@ or@@ a , and sent her down to Earth with a box , and told her , &quot; N@@ ever , ever open that box . &quot;
Well one day , curios@@ ity got the better of P@@ and@@ or@@ a , and she did open the box .
O@@ ut fle@@ w pl@@ agues , sor@@ ro@@ ws , and all sorts of ev@@ ils against man .
The only good thing in the box was hope .
J@@ ason then asked us , &quot; What happens when you open the box and hope isn &apos;t there ? &quot;
He p@@ aus@@ ed a few moments , le@@ an@@ ed to his right , and was gone .
This kind , intelligent young man from New Jer@@ sey had just commit@@ ted suicide .
I spoke with J@@ ason &apos;s parents that even@@ ing , and I suppose that , when I was speaking with them , that I didn &apos;t sound as if I was doing very well , because that very next day , their family rab@@ b@@ i called to check on me .
J@@ ason &apos;s parents had asked him to do so .
The coll@@ at@@ eral damage of suicide aff@@ ects so many people .
I pose these questions to you : What would you do if your family member , friend or loved one was su@@ ic@@ id@@ al ?
What would you say ?
Would you know what to say ?
In my experience , it &apos;s not just the talking that you do , but the listening .
L@@ isten to understand .
Don &apos;t argue , bl@@ ame , or tell the person you know how they feel , because you probably don &apos;t .
By just being there , you may just be the turning point that they need .
If you think someone is su@@ ic@@ id@@ al , don &apos;t be afraid to con@@ front them and ask the question .
One way of asking them the question is like this : &quot; O@@ thers in similar circumst@@ ances have thought about ending their life ; have you had these thoughts ? &quot;
Con@@ fron@@ ting the person hea@@ d-@@ on may just save their life and be the turning point for them .
Some other signs to look for : hop@@ el@@ ess@@ ness , believ@@ ing that things are terrible and never going to get better ; hel@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , believ@@ ing that there is nothing that you can do about it ; recent social with@@ dra@@ w@@ al ; and a loss of interest in life .
I came up with this talk just a couple of days ago , and I received an email from a lady that I &apos;d like to read you her letter .
She lost her son on Jan@@ u@@ ary 19 of this year , and she wrote this me this email just a couple of days ago , and it &apos;s with her per@@ mission and bl@@ essing that I read this to you .
&quot; H@@ i , K@@ evin . I imagine you &apos;re at the TED Con@@ ference .
That must be quite the experience to be there .
I &apos;m thinking I should go walk the bridge this wee@@ k@@ end .
Just wanted to drop you a note .
H@@ ope you get the word out to many people and they go home talking about it to their friends who tell their friends , etc .
I &apos;m still pretty num@@ b , but notic@@ ing more moments of really realiz@@ ing Mi@@ ke isn &apos;t coming home .
Mi@@ ke was driving from P@@ et@@ alu@@ ma to San Francisco to watch the 4@@ 9@@ ers game with his father on Jan@@ u@@ ary 19 .
He never made it there .
I called P@@ et@@ alu@@ ma police and re@@ ported him missing that even@@ ing .
The next morning , two off@@ ic@@ ers came to my home and re@@ ported that Mi@@ ke &apos;s car was down at the bridge .
A wit@@ ness had obser@@ ved him ju@@ mp@@ ing off the bridge at 1 : 5@@ 8 p@@ .@@ m@@ . the previ@@ ous day .
Thanks so much for standing up for those who may be only tempor@@ arily too wea@@ k to stand for themselves .
Who hasn &apos;t been low before without suffering from a true mental ill@@ ness ?
It shouldn &apos;t be so easy to end it .
My pr@@ ay@@ ers are with you for your fight .
The G@@ G@@ B , Gol@@ den G@@ ate Bri@@ dge , is supposed to be a passage across our beautiful b@@ ay , not a grav@@ ey@@ ard .
Good lu@@ ck this week . V@@ ick@@ y . &quot;
I can &apos;t imagine the courage it takes for her to go down to that bridge and walk the path that her son took that day , and also the courage just to carry on .
I &apos;d like to introduce you to a man I re@@ fer to as hope and courage .
On Mar@@ ch 11 of 2005 , I respon@@ ded to a radio call of a possible su@@ ic@@ id@@ al subject on the bridge si@@ de@@ walk near the nor@@ th to@@ wer .
I ro@@ de my mot@@ or@@ cycle down the si@@ de@@ walk and obser@@ ved this man , K@@ evin Ber@@ th@@ ia , standing on the si@@ de@@ walk .
When he saw me , he immediately traver@@ sed that pe@@ des@@ tri@@ an rai@@ l , and stood on that small pi@@ pe which goes around the to@@ wer .
For the next hour and a half , I listen@@ ed as K@@ evin spoke about his depression and hop@@ el@@ ess@@ ness .
K@@ evin decided on his own that day to come back over that rai@@ l and give life another chance .
When K@@ evin came back over , I con@@ grat@@ ul@@ ated him .
&quot; This is a new beginning , a new life . &quot;
But I asked him , &quot; What was it that made you come back and give hope and life another chance ? &quot;
And you know what he told me ?
He said , &quot; You listen@@ ed .
You let me speak , and you just listen@@ ed . &quot;
S@@ hor@@ tly after this in@@ cident , I received a letter from K@@ evin &apos;s mother , and I have that letter with me , and I &apos;d like to read it to you .
&quot; D@@ ear Mr. Bri@@ g@@ gs , No@@ thing will er@@ ase the events of Mar@@ ch 11 , but you are one of the reasons K@@ evin is still with us .
I truly believe K@@ evin was cr@@ ying out for help .
He has been diagno@@ sed with a mental ill@@ ness for which he has been proper@@ ly medic@@ ated .
I adop@@ ted K@@ evin when he was only six months old , completely un@@ aware of any her@@ ed@@ it@@ ary traits , but , thank God , now we know .
K@@ evin is straight , as he says .
We truly thank God for you .
S@@ in@@ cer@@ ely in@@ deb@@ ted to you , N@@ ar@@ vel@@ la Ber@@ th@@ ia . &quot;
And on the bottom she wr@@ ites , &quot; P@@ .@@ S. When I vis@@ ited San Francisco Gen@@ eral Ho@@ sp@@ ital that even@@ ing , you were lis@@ ted as the patient .
Bo@@ y , did I have to strai@@ gh@@ ten that one out . &quot;
Today , K@@ evin is a lo@@ ving father and contribu@@ ting member of society .
He spea@@ ks open@@ ly about the events that day and his depression in the hop@@ es that his story will inspire others .
Su@@ ici@@ de is not just something I &apos;ve en@@ coun@@ tered on the job .
It &apos;s personal .
My grand@@ father commit@@ ted suicide by pois@@ oning .
That act , although ending his own pain , rob@@ bed me from ever getting to know him .
This is what suicide does .
For most su@@ ic@@ id@@ al folks , or those cont@@ empl@@ ating suicide , they wouldn &apos;t think of hur@@ ting another person .
They just want their own pain to end .
Ty@@ pic@@ ally , this is accompl@@ ished in just three ways : sleep , drugs or al@@ co@@ ho@@ l , or death .
In my career , I &apos;ve respon@@ ded to and been involved in hundreds of mental ill@@ ness and suicide calls around the bridge .
Of those in@@ cidents I &apos;ve been directly involved with , I &apos;ve only lost two , but that &apos;s two too many .
One was J@@ ason .
The other was a man I spoke to for about an hour .
Dur@@ ing that time , he sho@@ ok my hand on three occas@@ ions .
On that final hand@@ sh@@ ake , he looked at me , and he said , &quot; K@@ evin , I &apos;m sorry , but I have to go . &quot;
And he le@@ ap@@ t .
H@@ or@@ ri@@ ble , absolutely horrible .
I do want to tell you , though , the vast majority of folks that we do get to contact on that bridge do not comm@@ it suicide .
Ad@@ di@@ tion@@ ally , that very few who have ju@@ mp@@ ed off the bridge and lived and can talk about it , that one to two percent , most of those folks have said that the second that they let go of that rai@@ l , they knew that they had made a mis@@ take and they wanted to live .
I tell people , the bridge not only connec@@ ts Mar@@ in to San Francisco , but people together also .
That connection , or bridge that we make , is something that each and every one of us should str@@ ive to do .
Su@@ ici@@ de is prev@@ ent@@ able .
There is help . There is hope .
Thank you very much .
The world makes you something that you &apos;re not , but you know inside what you are , and that question bur@@ ns in your heart : How will you become that ?
I may be some@@ what unique in this , but I am not alone , not alone at all .
So when I became a fashion model , I felt that I &apos;d finally achiev@@ ed the dream that I &apos;d always wanted since I was a young child .
My outside self finally mat@@ ched my inner truth , my inner self .
For complicated reasons which I &apos;ll get to later , when I look at this picture , at that time I felt like , Ge@@ ena , you &apos;ve done it , you &apos;ve made it , you have arrived .
But this past Oc@@ to@@ ber , I realized that I &apos;m only just beginning .
All of us are put in box@@ es by our family , by our religion , by our society , our moment in history , even our own bodies .
Some people have the courage to break free , not to accept the limit@@ ations im@@ posed by the color of their skin or by the beli@@ efs of those that surr@@ ound them .
Those people are always the threat to the status qu@@ o , to what is considered accep@@ table .
In my case , for the last nine years , some of my neighb@@ ors , some of my friends , colleagues , even my agent , did not know about my history .
I think , in myst@@ ery , this is called the reve@@ al .
Here is mine .
I was as@@ signed boy at birth based on the appear@@ ance of my gen@@ it@@ ali@@ a .
I remember when I was five years old in the Phili@@ pp@@ ines walking around our house , I would always wear this t-@@ shir@@ t on my head .
And my mom asked me , &quot; How come you always wear that t-@@ shir@@ t on your head ? &quot;
I said , &quot; M@@ om , this is my hair . I &apos;m a girl . &quot;
I knew then how to self-@@ identify .
G@@ ender has always been considered a fact , im@@ mu@@ table , but we now know it &apos;s actually more flu@@ id , complex and myst@@ er@@ ious .
Because of my success , I never had the courage to share my story , not because I thought what I am is wrong , but because of how the world tre@@ ats those of us who wish to break free .
Every day , I am so grat@@ eful because I am a woman .
I have a mom and dad and family who accep@@ ted me for who I am .
Many are not so fortun@@ ate .
There &apos;s a long tradition in A@@ sian culture that celebr@@ ates the flu@@ id myst@@ ery of gender .
There is a Bu@@ dd@@ his@@ t go@@ dd@@ ess of compassion .
There is a H@@ in@@ du go@@ dd@@ ess , hi@@ j@@ ra go@@ dd@@ ess .
So when I was eight years old , I was at a fi@@ est@@ a in the Phili@@ pp@@ ines celebr@@ ating these myst@@ eries .
I was in front of the stage , and I remember , out comes this beautiful woman right in front of me , and I remember that moment something hit me : That is the kind of woman I would like to be .
So when I was 15 years old , still dr@@ essing as a boy , I met this woman named T@@ .@@ L .
She is a trans@@ gender beauty p@@ age@@ ant man@@ ager .
That night she asked me , &quot; How come you are not jo@@ in@@ ing the beauty p@@ age@@ ant ? &quot;
She convinced me that if I jo@@ ined that she would take care of the reg@@ istr@@ ation fe@@ e and the gar@@ ments , and that night , I won best in swim@@ suit and best in long go@@ wn and placed second run@@ ner up among 4@@ 0-@@ plus candi@@ dat@@ es .
That moment changed my life .
All of a sudden , I was introduced to the world of beauty p@@ age@@ ants .
Not a lot of people could say that your first job is a p@@ age@@ ant qu@@ een for trans@@ gender women , but I &apos;ll take it .
So from 15 to 17 years old , I jo@@ ined the most pres@@ ti@@ gi@@ ous p@@ age@@ ant to the p@@ age@@ ant where it &apos;s at the back of the truc@@ k , literally , or sometimes it would be a p@@ av@@ ement next to a ri@@ ce field , and when it r@@ ains -- it r@@ ains a lot in the Phili@@ pp@@ ines -- the organiz@@ ers would have to move it inside someone &apos;s house .
I also experienced the go@@ od@@ ness of str@@ angers , especially when we would travel in remote pro@@ v@@ in@@ ces in the Phili@@ pp@@ ines .
But most importantly , I met some of my best friends in that community .
In 2001 , my mom , who had moved to San Francisco , called me and told me that my green card peti@@ tion came through , that I could now move to the United States .
I res@@ is@@ ted it .
I told my mom , &quot; M@@ om , I &apos;m having fun .
I &apos;m here with my friends , I love trav@@ eling , being a beauty p@@ age@@ ant qu@@ een . &quot;
But then two weeks later she called me , she said , &quot; Did you know that if you move to the United States you could change your name and gender mark@@ er ? &quot;
That was all I needed to hear .
My mom also told me to put two E &apos;s in the sp@@ elling of my name .
She also came with me when I had my surgery in Th@@ ail@@ and at 19 years old .
It &apos;s interesting , in some of the most rural cities in Th@@ ail@@ and , they perform some of the most pres@@ ti@@ gi@@ ous , safe and sophistic@@ ated surgery .
At that time in the United States , you needed to have surgery before you could change your name and gender mark@@ er .
So in 2001 , I moved to San Francisco , and I remember looking at my California driver &apos;s lic@@ ense with the name Ge@@ ena and gender mark@@ er F .
That was a powerful moment .
For some people , their I@@ .@@ D@@ . is their lic@@ ense to drive or even to get a drink , but for me , that was my lic@@ ense to live , to feel dig@@ ni@@ fied .
All of a sudden , my f@@ ears were minim@@ ized .
I felt that I could con@@ quer my dream and move to New York and be a model .
Many are not so fortun@@ ate .
I think of this woman named Is@@ l@@ an N@@ et@@ t@@ les .
She &apos;s from New York , she &apos;s a young woman who was cour@@ age@@ ously living her truth , but h@@ at@@ red ended her life .
For most of my community , this is the reality in which we live .
Our suicide rate is nine times higher than that of the general population .
Every No@@ v@@ ember 20 , we have a global vi@@ g@@ il for Trans@@ gender Day of Rem@@ embr@@ ance .
I &apos;m here at this stage because it &apos;s a long history of people who f@@ ought and stood up for in@@ justice .
This is Mar@@ sh@@ a P@@ . John@@ son and Sy@@ l@@ via Ri@@ ver@@ a .
Today , this very moment , is my real coming out .
I could no longer live my truth for and by myself .
I want to do my best to help others live their truth without sh@@ ame and ter@@ ror .
I am here , ex@@ posed , so that one day there will never be a need for a No@@ v@@ ember 20 vi@@ g@@ il .
My dee@@ p@@ est truth allowed me to accept who I am .
Will you ?
Thank you very much .
Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . K@@ a@@ thr@@ yn Sch@@ ul@@ z : Ge@@ ena , one quick question for you .
I &apos;m wondering what you would say , especially to parents , but in a more bro@@ ad way , to friends , to family , to anyone who fin@@ ds themselves en@@ counter@@ ing a child or a person who is stru@@ ggl@@ ing with and un@@ comfortable with a gender that &apos;s being as@@ signed them , what might you say to the family members of that person to help them become good and car@@ ing and kind family members to them ?
Ge@@ ena Ro@@ cer@@ o : Su@@ re . Well , first , really , I &apos;m so bl@@ essed .
The support system , with my mom especially , and my family , that in itself is just so powerful .
I remember every time I would co@@ ach young tr@@ ans women , I would ment@@ or them , and sometimes when they would call me and tell me that their parents can &apos;t accept it , I would pick up that phone call and tell my mom , &quot; M@@ om , can you call this woman ? &quot;
And sometimes it works , sometimes it doesn &apos;t , so — But it &apos;s just , gender identity is in the core of our being , right ?
I mean , we &apos;re all as@@ signed gender at birth , so what I &apos;m trying to do is to have this conversation that sometimes that gender as@@ sign@@ ment doesn &apos;t match , and there should be a space that would allow people to self-@@ identify , and that &apos;s a conversation that we should have with parents , with colleagues .
The trans@@ gender movement , it &apos;s at the very beginning , to compare to how the gay movement started .
There &apos;s still a lot of work that needs to be done .
There should be an understanding .
There should be a space of curios@@ ity and asking questions , and I hope all of you guys will be my al@@ lies .
K@@ S : Thank you . That was so lo@@ vely . G@@ R : Thank you .
In many patri@@ arch@@ al societies and trib@@ al societies , fa@@ thers are usually known by their sons , but I &apos;m one of the few fa@@ thers who is known by his daughter , and I am proud of it .
Mal@@ ala started her campaign for education and stood for her rights in 2007 , and when her efforts were hon@@ o@@ red in 2011 , and she was given the national y@@ ou@@ th peace pr@@ ize , and she became a very famous , very popular young girl of her country .
Be@@ fore that , she was my daughter , but now I am her father .
L@@ adi@@ es and gentlemen , if we gl@@ ance to human history , the story of women is the story of in@@ justice , inequality , violence and exploitation .
You see , in patri@@ arch@@ al societies , right from the very beginning , when a girl is born , her birth is not celebr@@ ated .
She is not wel@@ com@@ ed , ne@@ ither by father nor by mother .
The neighborhood comes and comm@@ is@@ er@@ ates with the mother , and nobody con@@ grat@@ ul@@ ates the father .
And a mother is very un@@ comfortable for having a girl child .
When she gives birth to the first girl child , first daughter , she is sad .
When she gives birth to the second daughter , she is shoc@@ ked , and in the expect@@ ation of a son , when she gives birth to a third daughter , she feels gu@@ il@@ ty like a crimin@@ al .
Not only the mother suff@@ ers , but the daughter , the new@@ ly born daughter , when she gro@@ ws old , she suff@@ ers too .
At the age of five , while she should be going to school , she st@@ ays at home and her bro@@ thers are ad@@ mit@@ ted in a school .
Un@@ til the age of 12 , somehow , she has a good life .
She can have fun .
She can play with her friends in the streets , and she can move around in the streets like a but@@ ter@@ fly .
But when she ent@@ ers her te@@ ens , when she becomes 13 years old , she is for@@ bi@@ dden to go out of her home without a male es@@ cor@@ t .
She is con@@ fin@@ ed under the four walls of her home .
She is no more a free individual .
She becomes the so@@ -@@ called hon@@ or of her father and of her bro@@ thers and of her family , and if she trans@@ gr@@ esses the code of that so@@ -@@ called hon@@ or , she could even be killed .
And it is also interesting that this so@@ -@@ called code of hon@@ or , it does not only affect the life of a girl , it also aff@@ ects the life of the male members of the family .
I know a family of seven s@@ is@@ ters and one brother , and that one brother , he has migr@@ ated to the G@@ ul@@ f countries , to ear@@ n a living for his seven s@@ is@@ ters and parents , because he thinks that it will be humi@@ li@@ ating if his seven s@@ is@@ ters learn a sk@@ ill and they go out of the home and ear@@ n some liv@@ eli@@ hood .
So this brother , he sacri@@ fices the jo@@ ys of his life and the happiness of his s@@ is@@ ters at the al@@ t@@ ar of so@@ -@@ called hon@@ or .
And there is one more nor@@ m of the patri@@ arch@@ al societies that is called o@@ be@@ dience .
A good girl is supposed to be very qui@@ et , very hum@@ ble and very sub@@ mis@@ sive .
It is the cr@@ it@@ eria .
The role model good girl should be very qui@@ et .
She is supposed to be sil@@ ent and she is supposed to accept the decisions of her father and mother and the decisions of el@@ ders , even if she does not like them .
If she is married to a man she doesn &apos;t like or if she is married to an old man , she has to accept , because she does not want to be du@@ b@@ bed as dis@@ o@@ be@@ di@@ ent .
If she is married very early , she has to accept .
O@@ ther@@ wise , she will be called dis@@ o@@ be@@ di@@ ent .
And what happens at the end ?
In the words of a po@@ et@@ ess , she is we@@ d@@ ded , bed@@ ded , and then she gives birth to more sons and dau@@ gh@@ ters .
And it is the ir@@ ony of the situation that this mother , she tea@@ ches the same lesson of o@@ be@@ dience to her daughter and the same lesson of hon@@ or to her sons .
And this v@@ ici@@ ous cycle goes on , goes on .
L@@ adi@@ es and gentlemen , this p@@ light of millions of women could be changed if we think differently , if women and men think differently , if men and women in the trib@@ al and patri@@ arch@@ al societies in the developing countries , if they can break a few nor@@ ms of family and society , if they can ab@@ ol@@ ish the discrimin@@ atory laws of the systems in their states , which go against the basic human rights of the women .
D@@ ear bro@@ thers and s@@ is@@ ters , when Mal@@ ala was born , and for the first time , believe me , I don &apos;t like new@@ born children , to be honest , but when I went and I looked into her eyes , believe me , I got extremely hon@@ o@@ red .
And long before she was born , I thought about her name , and I was fascin@@ ated with a her@@ o@@ ic leg@@ end@@ ary freedom fi@@ ghter in Afghanistan .
Her name was Mal@@ al@@ ai of M@@ ai@@ w@@ and , and I named my daughter after her .
A few days after Mal@@ ala was born , my daughter was born , my cous@@ in came -- and it was a co@@ in@@ cid@@ ence -- he came to my home and he brought a family tree , a family tree of the Y@@ ous@@ af@@ z@@ ai family , and when I looked at the family tree , it trac@@ ed back to 300 years of our ancest@@ ors .
But when I looked , all were men , and I picked my pen , drew a line from my name , and wrote , &quot; Mal@@ ala . &quot;
And when she grow old , when she was four and a half years old , I ad@@ mit@@ ted her in my school .
You will be asking , then , why should I mention about the ad@@ mission of a girl in a school ?
Yes , I must mention it .
It may be taken for gran@@ ted in Canada , in America , in many developed countries , but in poor countries , in patri@@ arch@@ al societies , in trib@@ al societies , it &apos;s a big event for the life of girl .
En@@ ro@@ ll@@ ment in a school means recogni@@ tion of her identity and her name .
Ad@@ mission in a school means that she has ent@@ ered the world of dreams and aspir@@ ations where she can explore her potenti@@ als for her future life .
I have five s@@ is@@ ters , and none of them could go to school , and you will be as@@ ton@@ ished , two weeks before , when I was f@@ illing out the Can@@ adi@@ an vis@@ a form , and I was f@@ illing out the family part of the form , I could not rec@@ all the sur@@ names of some of my s@@ is@@ ters .
And the reason was that I have never , never seen the names of my s@@ is@@ ters written on any document .
That was the reason that I valu@@ ed my daughter .
What my father could not give to my s@@ is@@ ters and to his dau@@ gh@@ ters , I thought I must change it .
I used to appreci@@ ate the intelligence and the brilli@@ ance of my daughter .
I encour@@ aged her to sit with me when my friends used to come .
I encour@@ aged her to go with me to different me@@ et@@ ings .
And all these good values , I tried to in@@ cul@@ c@@ ate in her person@@ ality .
And this was not only she , only Mal@@ ala .
I im@@ par@@ ted all these good values to my school , girl students and boy students as well .
I used education for em@@ an@@ cip@@ ation .
I taught my girls , I taught my girl students , to un@@ learn the lesson of o@@ be@@ dience .
I taught my boy students to un@@ learn the lesson of so@@ -@@ called p@@ seu@@ do@@ -@@ hon@@ or .
D@@ ear bro@@ thers and s@@ is@@ ters , we were str@@ iv@@ ing for more rights for women , and we were stru@@ ggl@@ ing to have more , more and more space for the women in society .
But we came across a new phenomenon .
It was le@@ th@@ al to human rights and particularly to women &apos;s rights .
It was called T@@ ali@@ ban@@ ization .
It means a complete neg@@ ation of women &apos;s participation in all political , econom@@ ical and social acti@@ vi@@ ties .
Hun@@ dre@@ ds of schools were lost .
G@@ ir@@ ls were pro@@ hi@@ b@@ ited from going to school .
Women were forced to wear ve@@ ils and they were stopped from going to the markets .
Mu@@ si@@ ci@@ ans were sil@@ enced , girls were f@@ log@@ ged and sing@@ ers were killed .
M@@ illi@@ ons were suffering , but few spoke , and it was the most scar@@ y thing when you have all around such people who kill and who flo@@ g , and you speak for your rights .
It &apos;s really the most scar@@ y thing .
At the age of 10 , Mal@@ ala stood , and she stood for the right of education .
She wrote a di@@ ary for the B@@ BC blog , she volunte@@ ered her@@ self for the New York Times document@@ aries , and she spoke from every platform she could .
And her voice was the most powerful voice .
It spread like a c@@ res@@ cend@@ o all around the world .
And that was the reason the T@@ ali@@ ban could not tol@@ er@@ ate her campaign , and on Oc@@ to@@ ber 9 2012 , she was shot in the head at point bl@@ ank range .
It was a do@@ om@@ s@@ day for my family and for me .
The world turned into a big black hole .
While my daughter was on the ver@@ ge of life and death , I wh@@ is@@ per@@ ed into the ears of my wife , &quot; Sh@@ ould I be bl@@ amed for what happened to my daughter and your daughter ? &quot;
And she ab@@ rup@@ tly told me , &quot; Please don &apos;t bl@@ ame yourself .
You stood for the right cause .
You put your life at st@@ ake for the cause of truth , for the cause of peace , and for the cause of education , and your daughter in inspired from you and she jo@@ ined you .
You both were on the right path and God will protect her . &quot;
These few words meant a lot to me , and I didn &apos;t ask this question again .
When Mal@@ ala was in the hospital , and she was going through the sev@@ ere p@@ ains and she had had sev@@ ere head@@ aches because her fac@@ ial ner@@ ve was cut down , I used to see a dark sh@@ ado@@ w sp@@ reading on the face of my wife .
But my daughter never compl@@ ained .
She used to tell us , &quot; I &apos;m fine with my cro@@ o@@ ked s@@ mile and with my num@@ b@@ ness in my face .
I &apos;ll be okay . Please don &apos;t worry . &quot;
She was a sol@@ ace for us , and she con@@ sol@@ ed us .
D@@ ear bro@@ thers and s@@ is@@ ters , we learned from her how to be res@@ ili@@ ent in the most difficult times , and I &apos;m gl@@ ad to share with you that despite being an ic@@ on for the rights of children and women , she is like any 16@@ -@@ year old girl .
She cri@@ es when her hom@@ ework is in@@ complete .
She quar@@ rels with her bro@@ thers , and I am very happy for that .
People ask me , what special is in my ment@@ or@@ ship which has made Mal@@ ala so b@@ old and so cour@@ age@@ ous and so vo@@ cal and pois@@ ed ?
I tell them , don &apos;t ask me what I did .
As@@ k me what I did not do .
I did not clip her wings , and that &apos;s all .
Thank you very much .
Thank you . Thank you very much . Thank you .
I had brain surgery 18 years ago , and since that time , brain science has become a personal passion of mine .
I &apos;m actually an engineer .
And first let me say , I recently jo@@ ined Google &apos;s Mo@@ on@@ shot group , where I had a di@@ vision , the dis@@ play di@@ vision in Google X , and the brain science work I &apos;m speaking about today is work I did before I jo@@ ined Google and on the side outside of Google .
So that said , there &apos;s a sti@@ g@@ ma when you have brain surgery .
Are you still smart or not ?
And if not , can you make yourself smart again ?
After my neuro@@ surgery , part of my brain was missing , and I had to deal with that .
It wasn &apos;t the gre@@ y matter , but it was the go@@ o@@ ey part dead center that makes key hormon@@ es and neuro@@ trans@@ mit@@ ters .
Im@@ medi@@ ately after my surgery , I had to decide what amoun@@ ts of each of over a do@@ zen powerful chemicals to take each day , because if I just took nothing , I would die within hours .
Every day now for 18 years -- every single day -- I &apos;ve had to try to decide the combin@@ ations and mix@@ tures of chemicals , and try to get them , to stay alive .
There have been several close calls .
But lu@@ ck@@ ily , I &apos;m an experim@@ ent@@ alis@@ t at heart , so I decided I would experiment to try to find more opti@@ mal do@@ s@@ ages because there really isn &apos;t a clear road map on this that &apos;s det@@ ailed .
I began to try different mix@@ tures , and I was blo@@ wn away by how tiny changes in do@@ s@@ ages dram@@ atically changed my sense of self , my sense of who I was , my thinking , my behavior towards people .
One particularly dram@@ atic case : for a couple months I actually tried do@@ s@@ ages and chemicals typical of a man in his early 20@@ s , and I was blo@@ wn away by how my thoughts changed .
I was an@@ gry all the time , I thought about sex constantly , and I thought I was the smar@@ test person in the entire world , and — — of course over the years I &apos;d met guys kind of like that , or maybe kind of ton@@ ed@@ -@@ down versions of that .
I was kind of extreme .
But to me , the surprise was , I wasn &apos;t trying to be arro@@ g@@ ant .
I was actually trying , with a little bit of insec@@ urity , to actually fix a problem in front of me , and it just didn &apos;t come out that way .
So I couldn &apos;t hand@@ le it .
I changed my do@@ s@@ ages .
But that experience , I think , gave me a new appreci@@ ation for men and what they might walk through , and I &apos;ve gotten along with men a lot better since then .
What I was trying to do with tu@@ ning these hormon@@ es and neuro@@ trans@@ mit@@ ters and so forth was to try to get my intelligence back after my ill@@ ness and surgery , my creative thought , my idea flow .
And I think mostly in images , and so for me that became a key me@@ tric -- how to get these mental images that I use as a way of rap@@ id prototy@@ ping , if you will , my ideas , trying on different new ideas for size , playing out scen@@ ari@@ os .
This kind of thinking isn &apos;t new .
Phili@@ os@@ oph@@ ers like Hu@@ me and Des@@ cartes and H@@ ob@@ bes saw things simil@@ arly .
They thought that mental images and ideas were actually the same thing .
There are those today that dis@@ pu@@ te that , and lots of deb@@ ates about how the mind works , but for me it &apos;s simple : M@@ ental images , for most of us , are central in inv@@ enti@@ ve and creative thinking .
So after several years , I tu@@ ned myself up and I have lots of great , really vi@@ vi@@ d mental images with a lot of sophistic@@ ation and the analy@@ tical back@@ bone behind them .
And so now I &apos;m working on , how can I get these mental images in my mind out to my computer screen faster ?
Can you imagine , if you will , a movie direc@@ tor being able to use her imagination alone to direct the world in front of her ?
Or a musici@@ an to get the music out of his head ?
There are incredible possibilities with this as a way for creative people to share at light speed .
And the truth is , the re@@ main@@ ing bot@@ t@@ l@@ en@@ ec@@ k in being able to do this is just up@@ ping the resol@@ ution of brain s@@ can systems .
So let me show you why I think we &apos;re pretty close to getting there by sharing with you two recent experiments from two top neuro@@ science groups .
B@@ oth used f@@ M@@ R@@ I technology -- func@@ tional mag@@ ne@@ tic res@@ on@@ ance imag@@ ing technology -- to image the brain , and here is a brain s@@ can set from Gi@@ or@@ gi@@ o G@@ an@@ is and his colleagues at Harvard .
And the le@@ f@@ t-@@ hand col@@ um@@ n shows a brain s@@ can of a person looking at an image .
The middle col@@ um@@ n shows the br@@ ain@@ s@@ can of that same individual imagin@@ ing , seeing that same image .
And the right col@@ um@@ n was created by sub@@ trac@@ ting the middle col@@ um@@ n from the left col@@ um@@ n , showing the difference to be nearly zero .
This was repe@@ ated on lots of different individuals with lots of different images , always with a similar result .
The difference between seeing an image and imagin@@ ing seeing that same image is next to nothing .
N@@ ext let me share with you one other experiment , this from J@@ ack G@@ all@@ ant &apos;s lab at C@@ al Ber@@ k@@ el@@ ey .
They &apos;ve been able to dec@@ ode br@@ ain@@ waves into recogni@@ z@@ able visual fields .
So let me set this up for you .
In this experiment , individuals were shown hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while sc@@ ans were made of their brains to create a large libr@@ ary of their brain re@@ acting to video se@@ quences .
Then a new movie was shown with new images , new people , new animals in it , and a new s@@ can set was recor@@ ded .
The computer , using brain s@@ can data alone , dec@@ o@@ ded that new brain s@@ can to show what it thought the individual was actually seeing .
On the ri@@ ght-@@ hand side , you see the computer &apos;s guess , and on the le@@ f@@ t-@@ hand side , the pres@@ ented clip .
This is the j@@ aw@@ -@@ dro@@ p@@ per .
We are so close to being able to do this .
We just need to up the resol@@ ution .
And now remember that when you see an image versus when you imagine that same image , it creates the same brain s@@ can .
So this was done with the high@@ est-@@ resol@@ ution brain s@@ can systems available today , and their resol@@ ution has increas@@ ed really about a thou@@ sand@@ fold in the last several years .
N@@ ext we need to increase the resol@@ ution another thou@@ sand@@ fold to get a deeper g@@ lim@@ p@@ se .
How do we do that ?
There &apos;s a lot of techniques in this approach .
One way is to cr@@ ack open your sk@@ ull and put in elec@@ tro@@ des .
I &apos;m not for that .
There &apos;s a lot of new imag@@ ing techniques being pro@@ posed , some even by me , but given the recent success of M@@ R@@ I , first we need to ask the question , is it the end of the road with this technology ?
Con@@ venti@@ onal wisdom says the only way to get higher resol@@ ution is with bigger mag@@ nets , but at this point bigger mag@@ nets only offer incre@@ mental resol@@ ution impro@@ vements , not the thou@@ sand@@ fold we need .
I &apos;m putting forward an idea : instead of bigger mag@@ nets , let &apos;s make better mag@@ nets .
There &apos;s some new technology break@@ through@@ s in nan@@ o@@ science when appli@@ ed to mag@@ ne@@ tic structures that have created a whole new class of mag@@ nets , and with these mag@@ nets , we can lay down very fine det@@ ailed mag@@ ne@@ tic field patterns throughout the brain , and using those , we can actually create ho@@ lo@@ grap@@ hic@@ -@@ like inter@@ ference structures to get precis@@ ion control over many patterns ,
as is shown here by shif@@ ting things .
We can create much more complicated structures with slightly different arrang@@ ements , kind of like making S@@ pi@@ ro@@ graph .
So why does that matter ?
A lot of effort in M@@ R@@ I over the years has gone into making really big , really huge mag@@ nets , right ?
But yet most of the recent adv@@ ances in resol@@ ution have actually come from in@@ gen@@ i@@ ously cl@@ ever en@@ co@@ ding and dec@@ o@@ ding solutions in the F@@ .@@ M. radio frequ@@ ency trans@@ mit@@ ters and rece@@ i@@ vers in the M@@ R@@ I systems .
Let &apos;s also , instead of a uni@@ form mag@@ ne@@ tic field , put down struc@@ tured mag@@ ne@@ tic patterns in addition to the F@@ .@@ M. radio frequ@@ encies .
So by combin@@ ing the mag@@ ne@@ tics patterns with the patterns in the F@@ .@@ M. radio frequ@@ encies proc@@ essing which can mas@@ sively increase the information that we can extr@@ act in a single s@@ can .
And on top of that , we can then layer our ever@@ -@@ growing knowledge of brain structure and memory to create a thou@@ sand@@ fold increase that we need .
And using f@@ M@@ R@@ I , we should be able to measure not just oxy@@ gen@@ ated blood flow , but the hormon@@ es and neuro@@ trans@@ mit@@ ters I &apos;ve talked about and maybe even the direct neu@@ ral activity , which is the dream .
We &apos;re going to be able to du@@ mp our ideas directly to digital media .
Could you imagine if we could le@@ ap@@ fro@@ g language and communicate directly with human thought ?
What would we be capable of then ?
And how will we learn to deal with the tru@@ ths of un@@ fil@@ tered human thought ?
You think the Internet was big .
These are huge questions .
It might be ir@@ res@@ is@@ tible as a tool to am@@ pli@@ fy our thinking and communication skills .
And indeed , this very same tool may prove to lead to the cure for Alzheimer &apos;s and similar diseases .
We have little option but to open this door .
Regard@@ less , pick a year -- will it happen in five years or 15 years ?
It &apos;s hard to imagine it taking much longer .
We need to learn how to take this step together .
Thank you .
I &apos;m going to talk to you ton@@ ight about coming out of the clo@@ set , and not in the traditional sense , not just the gay clo@@ set .
I think we all have clo@@ sets .
Your clo@@ set may be telling someone you love her for the first time , or telling someone that you &apos;re pregn@@ ant , or telling someone you have cancer , or any of the other hard conversations we have throughout our lives .
All a clo@@ set is is a hard conversation , and although our top@@ ics may v@@ ary tremend@@ ously , the experience of being in and coming out of the clo@@ set is universal .
It is scar@@ y , and we hate it , and it needs to be done .
S@@ ever@@ al years ago , I was working at the South S@@ ide Wal@@ n@@ ut C@@ af@@ e , a local din@@ er in town , and during my time there I would go through ph@@ ases of milit@@ ant les@@ bi@@ an inten@@ sity : not sh@@ aving my ar@@ mp@@ its , quot@@ ing An@@ i Di@@ Franc@@ o ly@@ ri@@ cs as go@@ spe@@ l .
And depend@@ ing on the b@@ ag@@ g@@ iness of my car@@ go shor@@ ts and how recently I had sh@@ av@@ ed my head , the question would often be spr@@ ung on me , usually by a little kid : &quot; U@@ m , are you a boy or are you a girl ? &quot;
And there would be an aw@@ k@@ ward silence at the table .
I &apos;d cl@@ en@@ ch my ja@@ w a little ti@@ ghter , hold my coffee po@@ t with a little more ven@@ ge@@ ance .
The dad would aw@@ k@@ war@@ dly shu@@ ff@@ le his newsp@@ aper and the mom would sho@@ ot a ch@@ illing st@@ are at her kid .
But I would say nothing , and I would see@@ the inside .
And it got to the point where every time I walked up to a table that had a kid anywhere between three and 10 years old , I was ready to fight .
And that is a terrible feeling .
So I prom@@ is@@ ed myself , the next time , I would say something .
I would have that hard conversation .
So within a matter of weeks , it happens again .
&quot; Are you a boy or are you a girl ? &quot;
F@@ am@@ ili@@ ar silence , but this time I &apos;m ready , and I am about to go all Women &apos;s Stu@@ dies 10@@ 1 on this table . I &apos;ve got my B@@ et@@ ty Fri@@ ed@@ an quot@@ es .
I &apos;ve got my Gl@@ ori@@ a Ste@@ in@@ em quot@@ es .
I &apos;ve even got this little bit from &quot; V@@ ag@@ ina Mon@@ ologues &quot; I &apos;m going to do .
So I take a deep breath and I look down and star@@ ing back at me is a four@@ -year-old girl in a p@@ ink d@@ ress , not a challenge to a fem@@ in@@ ist du@@ el , just a kid with a question : &quot; Are you a boy or are you a girl ? &quot;
So I take another deep breath , squ@@ at down to next to her , and say , &quot; Hey , I know it &apos;s kind of conf@@ using .
My hair is short like a boy &apos;s , and I wear boy &apos;s clo@@ thes , but I &apos;m a girl , and you know how sometimes you like to wear a p@@ ink d@@ ress , and sometimes you like to wear your com@@ fy jam@@ mi@@ es ?
Well , I &apos;m more of a com@@ fy jam@@ mi@@ es kind of girl . &quot;
And this kid looks me dead in the eye , without missing a beat , and says , &quot; My favorite p@@ a@@ jam@@ as are pur@@ ple with fish .
Can I get a p@@ anc@@ ake , please ? &quot;
And that was it . Just , &quot; Oh , okay . You &apos;re a girl .
How about that p@@ anc@@ ake ? &quot;
It was the eas@@ i@@ est hard conversation I have ever had .
And why ? Because P@@ anc@@ ake G@@ ir@@ l and I , we were both real with each other .
So like many of us , I &apos;ve lived in a few clo@@ sets in my life , and yeah , most often , my walls happened to be rain@@ b@@ ow .
But inside , in the dark , you can &apos;t tell what color the walls are .
You just know what it feels like to live in a clo@@ set .
So really , my clo@@ set is no different than y@@ ours or y@@ ours or y@@ ours .
Su@@ re , I &apos;ll give you 100 reasons why coming out of my clo@@ set was harder than coming out of y@@ ours , but here &apos;s the thing : H@@ ard is not relative .
H@@ ard is hard .
Who can tell me that expl@@ aining to someone you &apos;ve just dec@@ lar@@ ed ban@@ k@@ rup@@ t@@ cy is harder than telling someone you just che@@ ated on them ?
Who can tell me that his coming out story is harder than telling your fi@@ ve@@ -year-old you &apos;re getting a div@@ or@@ ce ?
There is no harder , there is just hard .
We need to stop ran@@ king our hard against everyone else &apos;s hard to make us feel better or worse about our clo@@ sets and just comm@@ is@@ er@@ ate on the fact that we all have hard .
At some point in our lives , we all live in clo@@ sets , and they may feel safe , or at least saf@@ er than what lies on the other side of that door .
But I am here to tell you , no matter what your walls are made of , a clo@@ set is no place for a person to live .
Thanks . So imagine yourself 20 years ago .
M@@ e , I had a pon@@ y@@ tail , a str@@ a@@ pl@@ ess d@@ ress , and high-@@ he@@ eled shoes .
I was not the milit@@ ant les@@ bi@@ an ready to fight any four@@ -year-old that walked into the caf@@ e .
I was fro@@ zen by fear , cur@@ led up in the corner of my p@@ itch@@ -@@ black clo@@ set c@@ lut@@ ching my gay gren@@ ade , and moving one muscle is the scar@@ i@@ est thing I have ever done .
My family , my friends , complete str@@ angers -- I had spent my entire life trying to not dis@@ ap@@ point these people , and now I was turning the world up@@ side down on purpose .
I was bur@@ ning the pages of the s@@ cript we had all followed for so long , but if you do not throw that gren@@ ade , it will kill you .
One of my most mem@@ or@@ able gren@@ ade to@@ sses was at my sister &apos;s we@@ d@@ ding .
It was the first time that many in attend@@ ance knew I was gay , so in doing my m@@ aid of hon@@ or du@@ ties , in my black d@@ ress and he@@ els , I walked around to tables and finally land@@ ed on a table of my parents &apos; friends , folks that had known me for years .
And after a little small talk , one of the women sh@@ ou@@ ted out , &quot; I love N@@ athan L@@ ane ! &quot;
And the bat@@ tle of gay rel@@ at@@ ability had beg@@ un .
&quot; As@@ h , have you ever been to the C@@ astr@@ o ? &quot;
&quot; Well , yeah , actually , we have friends in San Francisco . &quot;
&quot; Well , we &apos;ve never been there but we &apos;ve heard it &apos;s fabul@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; As@@ h , do you know my h@@ air@@ dr@@ ess@@ er An@@ ton@@ i@@ o ?
He &apos;s really good and he has never talked about a gir@@ l@@ friend . &quot;
&quot; As@@ h , what &apos;s your favorite TV show ?
Our favorite TV show ? F@@ av@@ or@@ ite : Will &amp; amp ; Gr@@ ace .
And you know who we love ? J@@ ack .
J@@ ack is our favorite . &quot;
And then one woman , stu@@ mp@@ ed but wan@@ ting so des@@ per@@ ately to show her support , to let me know she was on my side , she finally blu@@ r@@ ted out , &quot; Well , sometimes my husband w@@ ears p@@ ink shir@@ ts . &quot;
And I had a choice in that moment , as all gren@@ ade thro@@ wers do .
I could go back to my gir@@ l@@ friend and my g@@ ay@@ -@@ lo@@ ving table and mo@@ ck their respon@@ ses , ch@@ as@@ tise their un@@ world@@ l@@ iness and their in@@ ability to jump through the poli@@ tically correct gay ho@@ ops I had brought with me , or I could empath@@ ize with them and realize that that was maybe one of the hard@@ est things they had ever done , that starting and having that conversation was them coming out of their clo@@ sets .
Su@@ re , it would have been easy to point out where they felt short .
It &apos;s a lot harder to meet them where they are and ac@@ knowledge the fact that they were trying .
And what else can you ask someone to do but try ?
If you &apos;re going to be real with someone , you got@@ ta be ready for real in return .
So hard conversations are still not my strong suit .
As@@ k anybody I have ever d@@ ated .
But I &apos;m getting better , and I follow what I like to call the three P@@ anc@@ ake G@@ ir@@ l principles .
Now , please view this through g@@ ay@@ -@@ colo@@ red l@@ en@@ ses , but know what it takes to come out of any clo@@ set is essentially the same .
Num@@ ber one : B@@ e authenti@@ c .
Take the ar@@ mor off . B@@ e yourself .
That kid in the caf@@ e had no ar@@ mor , but I was ready for bat@@ tle .
If you want someone to be real with you , they need to know that you ble@@ ed too .
Num@@ ber two : B@@ e direct . Just say it . Ri@@ p the B@@ and-@@ A@@ id off .
If you know you are gay , just say it .
If you tell your parents you might be gay , they will hold out hope that this will change .
Do not give them that sense of fal@@ se hope .
And number three , and most important -- B@@ e un@@ apo@@ log@@ e@@ tic .
You are speaking your truth .
N@@ ever apo@@ logi@@ ze for that .
And some folks may have gotten hur@@ t along the way , so sure , apo@@ logi@@ ze for what you &apos;ve done , but never apo@@ logi@@ ze for who you are .
And yeah , some folks may be dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted , but that is on them , not on you .
Those are their expect@@ ations of who you are , not y@@ ours .
That is their story , not y@@ ours .
The only story that matters is the one that you want to write .
So the next time you find yourself in a p@@ itch@@ -@@ black clo@@ set c@@ lut@@ ching your gren@@ ade , know we have all been there before .
And you may feel so very alone , but you are not .
And we know it &apos;s hard but we need you out here , no matter what your walls are made of , because I gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ e you there are others pe@@ ering through the ke@@ y@@ holes of their clo@@ sets looking for the next br@@ ave sou@@ l to b@@ ust a door open , so be that person and show the world that we are bigger than our clo@@ sets and that a clo@@ set is no place for a person to truly live .
Thank you , B@@ oul@@ der . En@@ joy your night .
In@@ tel@@ lig@@ ence -- what is it ?
If we take a look back at the history of how intelligence has been vie@@ wed , one sem@@ inal example has been Ed@@ s@@ ger Di@@ j@@ k@@ str@@ a &apos;s famous quote that &quot; the question of whether a machine can think is about as interesting as the question of whether a sub@@ marine can swi@@ m . &quot;
Now , Ed@@ s@@ ger Di@@ j@@ k@@ str@@ a , when he wrote this , int@@ ended it as a cri@@ tic@@ ism of the early pi@@ on@@ e@@ ers of computer science , like Al@@ an Tur@@ ing .
However , if you take a look back and think about what have been the most em@@ power@@ ing innovations that en@@ ab@@ led us to build artificial machines that swi@@ m and artificial machines that &#91; fly &#93; , you find that it was only through understanding the under@@ lying physical mechan@@ is@@ ms of swim@@ ming and flight that we were able to build these machines .
And so , several years ago , I under@@ took a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechan@@ is@@ ms under@@ lying intelligence .
Let &apos;s take a step back .
Let &apos;s first begin with a thought experiment .
P@@ re@@ tend that you &apos;re an alien race that doesn &apos;t know anything about Earth biology or Earth neuro@@ science or Earth intelligence , but you have amazing tel@@ esc@@ opes and you &apos;re able to watch the Earth , and you have amaz@@ ingly long lives , so you &apos;re able to watch the Earth over millions , even billions of years .
And you observe a really strange effect .
You observe that , over the course of the mill@@ en@@ nia , Earth is continu@@ ally bomb@@ ar@@ ded with as@@ ter@@ o@@ ids up until a point , and that at some point , correspon@@ ding roughly to our year , 2000 A@@ D , as@@ ter@@ o@@ ids that are on a coll@@ ision course with the Earth that otherwise would have col@@ li@@ ded myst@@ er@@ i@@ ously get de@@ fl@@ ected or they det@@ on@@ ate before they can hit the Earth .
Now of course , as ear@@ th@@ l@@ ings , we know the reason would be that we &apos;re trying to save ourselves .
We &apos;re trying to prevent an impact .
But if you &apos;re an alien race who doesn &apos;t know any of this , doesn &apos;t have any concept of Earth intelligence , you &apos;d be forced to put together a physical theory that expl@@ ains how , up until a certain point in time , as@@ ter@@ o@@ ids that would dem@@ ol@@ ish the surface of a planet myst@@ er@@ i@@ ously stop doing that .
And so I claim that this is the same question as understanding the physical nature of intelligence .
So in this program that I under@@ took several years ago , I looked at a variety of different thre@@ ads across science , across a variety of discipl@@ ines , that were poin@@ ting , I think , towards a single , under@@ lying mechan@@ ism for intelligence .
In cosmo@@ logy , for example , there have been a variety of different thre@@ ads of evidence that our universe appe@@ ars to be fin@@ ely tu@@ ned for the development of intelligence , and , in particular , for the development of universal states that maxim@@ ize the diversity of possible fu@@ tures .
In game play , for example , in Go -- everyone rem@@ em@@ bers in 199@@ 7 when I@@ B@@ M &apos;s De@@ ep B@@ lue beat G@@ arry K@@ as@@ par@@ o@@ v at ch@@ ess -- fe@@ wer people are aware that in the past 10 years or so , the game of Go , argu@@ ably a much more challeng@@ ing game because it has a much higher bran@@ ching fac@@ tor , has also started to suc@@ cu@@ m@@ b to computer game players
for the same reason : the best techniques right now for computers playing Go are techniques that try to maxim@@ ize future options during game play .
Fin@@ ally , in robo@@ tic motion planning , there have been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to take advantage of abilities of robots to maxim@@ ize future freedom of action in order to accompl@@ ish complex tas@@ ks .
And so , taking all of these different thre@@ ads and putting them together , I asked , starting several years ago , is there an under@@ lying mechan@@ ism for intelligence that we can fac@@ tor out of all of these different thre@@ ads ?
Is there a single equ@@ ation for intelligence ?
And the answer , I believe , is yes . &#91; &quot; F = T ∇ S@@ τ &quot; &#93; What you &apos;re seeing is probably the clo@@ s@@ est equivalent to an E = m@@ c ² for intelligence that I &apos;ve seen .
So what you &apos;re seeing here is a stat@@ ement of correspon@@ dence that intelligence is a force , F , that acts so as to maxim@@ ize future freedom of action .
It acts to maxim@@ ize future freedom of action , or keep options open , with some strength T , with the diversity of possible accessible fu@@ tures , S , up to some future time horiz@@ on , t@@ au .
In short , intelligence doesn &apos;t like to get tr@@ apped .
In@@ tel@@ lig@@ ence tries to maxim@@ ize future freedom of action and keep options open .
And so , given this one equ@@ ation , it &apos;s natural to ask , so what can you do with this ?
How predic@@ tive is it ?
Does it predict human@@ -@@ level intelligence ?
Does it predict artificial intelligence ?
So I &apos;m going to show you now a video that will , I think , demonstr@@ ate some of the amazing applications of just this single equ@@ ation .
Narr@@ ator : R@@ ec@@ ent research in cosmo@@ logy has sugges@@ ted that univer@@ ses that produce more dis@@ order , or &quot; entr@@ opy , &quot; over their life@@ times should tend to have more favor@@ able conditions for the existence of intelligent beings such as ourselves .
But what if that tent@@ ative cosmo@@ logical connection between entr@@ opy and intelligence h@@ ints at a deeper relationship ?
What if intelligent behavior doesn &apos;t just cor@@ rel@@ ate with the production of long-term entr@@ opy , but actually emerg@@ es directly from it ?
To find out , we developed a software engine called En@@ trop@@ ica , designed to maxim@@ ize the production of long-term entr@@ opy of any system that it fin@@ ds itself in .
Amaz@@ ingly , En@@ trop@@ ica was able to pass multiple animal intelligence tests , play human games , and even ear@@ n money tr@@ ad@@ ing stoc@@ ks , all without being instruc@@ ted to do so .
Here are some examples of En@@ trop@@ ica in action .
Just like a human standing u@@ pr@@ ight without fall@@ ing over , here we see En@@ trop@@ ica autom@@ atically bal@@ ancing a po@@ le using a car@@ t .
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave En@@ trop@@ ica a goal .
It simply decided on its own to balance the po@@ le .
This bal@@ ancing ability will have appli@@ actions for human@@ oid robo@@ tics and human ass@@ is@@ tive technologies .
Just as some animals can use objects in their environments as tools to reach into nar@@ row spaces , here we see that En@@ trop@@ ica , again on its own initi@@ ative , was able to move a large dis@@ k repres@@ enting an animal around so as to cause a small dis@@ k , repres@@ enting a tool , to reach into a con@@ fin@@ ed space holding a third dis@@ k and release the third dis@@ k from its initi@@ ally fix@@ ed position .
This tool use ability will have applications for smart manufactu@@ ring and agriculture .
In addition , just as some other animals are able to co@@ operate by pul@@ ling opposite ends of a ro@@ pe at the same time to release food , here we see that En@@ trop@@ ica is able to accompl@@ ish a model version of that task .
This co@@ oper@@ ative ability has interesting implications for economic planning and a variety of other fields .
En@@ trop@@ ica is broad@@ ly applic@@ able to a variety of dom@@ ains .
For example , here we see it success@@ fully playing a game of pon@@ g against itself , illustr@@ ating its potential for gam@@ ing .
Here we see En@@ trop@@ ica orches@@ tr@@ ating new connections on a social network where friends are constantly fall@@ ing out of touch and success@@ fully keeping the network well connected .
This same network orches@@ tr@@ ation ability also has applications in health care , energy , and intelligence .
Here we see En@@ trop@@ ica direc@@ ting the path@@ s of a fle@@ et of ships , success@@ fully disco@@ vering and uti@@ liz@@ ing the Pan@@ ama Can@@ al to glob@@ ally ex@@ tend its reach from the Atlan@@ tic to the Paci@@ fic .
By the same to@@ ken , En@@ trop@@ ica is broad@@ ly applic@@ able to problems in autonom@@ ous de@@ fense , log@@ is@@ tics and transport@@ ation .
Fin@@ ally , here we see En@@ trop@@ ica spon@@ tane@@ ously disco@@ vering and ex@@ ecu@@ ting a bu@@ y-@@ low , sel@@ l@@ -@@ high strategy on a simul@@ ated range tr@@ aded stock , success@@ fully growing asse@@ ts under management exponenti@@ ally .
This risk management ability will have bro@@ ad applications in finance and insur@@ ance .
Ale@@ x W@@ iss@@ ner@@ -@@ Gro@@ ss : So what you &apos;ve just seen is that a variety of sig@@ nature human intelligent cognitive behavi@@ ors such as tool use and walking u@@ pr@@ ight and social co@@ operation all follow from a single equ@@ ation , which drives a system to maxim@@ ize its future freedom of action .
Now , there &apos;s a profound ir@@ ony here .
Go@@ ing back to the beginning of the usage of the term robot , the play &quot; R@@ U@@ R , &quot; there was always a concept that if we developed machine intelligence , there would be a cyber@@ ne@@ tic re@@ vol@@ t .
The machines would rise up against us .
One major conse@@ quence of this work is that maybe all of these decades , we &apos;ve had the whole concept of cyber@@ ne@@ tic re@@ vol@@ t in re@@ verse .
It &apos;s not that machines first become intelligent and then me@@ gal@@ om@@ ani@@ ac@@ al and try to take over the world .
It &apos;s quite the opposite , that the ur@@ ge to take control of all possible fu@@ tures is a more fundamental principle than that of intelligence , that general intelligence may in fact emer@@ ge directly from this sort of contr@@ ol@@ -@@ gr@@ ab@@ bing , rather than vice vers@@ a .
Another important conse@@ quence is goal see@@ king .
I &apos;m often asked , how does the ability to see@@ k goals follow from this sort of fr@@ am@@ ework ?
And the answer is , the ability to see@@ k goals will follow directly from this in the following sense : just like you would travel through a tun@@ nel , a bot@@ t@@ l@@ en@@ ec@@ k in your future path space , in order to achieve many other di@@ verse objec@@ tives later on , or just like you would invest in a financial security , re@@ duc@@ ing your shor@@ t-@@ term li@@ qu@@ id@@ ity in order to increase your wealth over the long term , goal see@@ king emerg@@ es directly
from a long-term drive to increase future freedom of action .
Fin@@ ally , Richard F@@ ey@@ n@@ man , famous physi@@ c@@ ist , once wrote that if human civilization were destro@@ yed and you could pass only a single concept on to our descend@@ ants to help them re@@ build civilization , that concept should be that all matter around us is made out of tiny elements that attr@@ act each other when they &apos;re far apart but repe@@ l each other when they &apos;re close together .
My equivalent of that stat@@ ement to pass on to descend@@ ants to help them build artificial intelli@@ gen@@ ces or to help them understand human intelligence , is the following : In@@ tel@@ lig@@ ence should be vie@@ wed as a physical process that tries to maxim@@ ize future freedom of action and avoid con@@ str@@ ain@@ ts in its own future .
Thank you very much .
